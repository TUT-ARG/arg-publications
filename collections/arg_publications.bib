abstract = "This work addresses the problem of multichannel source separation combining two powerful approaches, multichannel spectral factorization with recent monophonic deep-learning (DL) based spectrum inference. Individual source spectra at different channels are estimated with a Masker-Denoiser Twin Network (MaD TwinNet), able to model long-term temporal patterns of a musical piece. The monophonic source spectrograms are used within a spatial covariance mixing model based on Complex Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) that predicts the spatial characteristics of each source. The proposed framework is evaluated on the task of singing voice separation with a large multichannel dataset. Experimental results show that our joint DL+CNMF method outperforms both the individual monophonic DL-based separation and the multichannel CNMF baseline methods.",

    abstract = "Audio representation learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs) emerged as an alternative approach to hand-crafted features. For achieving high performance, DNNs often need a large amount of annotated data which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a method for learning audio representations, aligning the learned latent representations of audio and associated tags. Aligning is done by maximizing the agreement of the latent representations of audio and tags, using a contrastive loss. The result is an audio embedding model which reflects acoustic and semantic characteristics of sounds. We evaluate the quality of our embedding model, measuring its performance as a feature extractor on three different tasks (namely, sound event recognition, and music genre and musical instrument classification), and investigate what type of characteristics the model captures. Our results are promising, sometimes in par with the state-of-the-art in the considered tasks and the embeddings produced with our method are well correlated with some acoustic descriptors.",

abstract = "Recent approaches for music source separation are almost exclusively based on deep neural networks, mostly employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although RNNs are in many cases superior than other types of deep neural networks for sequence processing, they are known to have specific difficulties in training and parallelization, especially for the typically long sequences encountered in music source separation. In this paper we present a use-case of replacing RNNs with depth-wise separable (DWS) convolutions, which are a lightweight and faster variant of the typical convolutions. We focus on singing voice separation, employing an RNN architecture, and we replace the RNNs with DWS convolutions (DWS-CNNs). We conduct an ablation study and examine the effect of the number of channels and layers of DWS-CNNs on the source separation performance, by utilizing the standard metrics of signal-to-artifacts, signal-to-interference, and signal-to-distortion ratio. Our results show that by replacing RNNs with DWS-CNNs yields an improvement of 1.20, 0.06, 0.37 dB, respectively, while using only 20.57{\%} of the amount of parameters of the RNN architecture.",

This paper presents a non-uniform quantization approach which allows for dynamic quantization of DNN parameters for different layers and within the same layer. A virtual bit shift (VBS) scheme is also proposed to improve the accuracy of the proposed scheme. Our method reduces the memory requirements, preserving the performance of the network. The performance of our method is validated in a speech enhancement application, where a fully connected DNN is used to predict the clean speech spectrum from the input noisy speech spectrum. A DNN is optimized and its memory footprint and performance are evaluated using the short-time objective intelligibility, STOI, metric. The application of the low-bit quantization allows a 50{\%} reduction of the DNN memory footprint while the STOI performance drops only by 2.7{\%}.",

    abstract = "Audio source separation is usually achieved by estimating the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude of each source, and then applying a spectrogram inversion algorithm to retrieve time-domain signals. In particular, the multiple input spectrogram inversion (MISI) algorithm has been exploited successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter. First, it has originally been introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals. Experiments conducted on a speech separation task show that oMISI performs as well as its offline counterpart, thus demonstrating its potential for real-time source separation.",

Both the ensemble and the neural network fusion of magnitude spectra obtained with these approaches have been shown to improve the objective perceptual quality with synthetic mixtures of data. This work generalizes the ensemble approach by proposing neural network layers to predict time-frequency varying weights for the combination of the two magnitude spectra. In order to combine the best individual magnitude spectrum estimates, the weight prediction network is trained after the time-frequency mask and magnitude spectrum sub-networks have been separately trained for their corresponding objectives and their weights have been frozen. Using the publicly available CHiME3 -challenge data, which consists of both simulated and real speech recordings in everyday environments with noise and interference, the proposed approach leads to significantly higher noise suppression in terms of segmental source-to-distortion ratio over the alternative approaches. In addition, the approach achieves similar improvements in the average objective instrumentally measured intelligibility scores with respect to the best achieved scores.",

However, captured speech typically contains dynamic non-speech interference sources and noise. Therefore, the TDoA estimates fluctuate between speech and interference. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied for Time-Frequency (TF) masking for Acoustic Source Localization (ASL) to filter out non-speech components from a speaker location likelihood function. However, the type of TF mask for this task is not obvious. Secondly, the DNN should estimate the TDoA values, but existing solutions estimate the TF mask instead. To overcome these issues, a direct formulation of the TF masking as a part of a DNN-based ASL structure is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed network operates in an online manner, i.e., producing estimates frame-by-frame. Combined with the use of recurrent layers it exploits the sequential progression of speaker related TDoAs. Training with different microphone spacings allows model re-use for different microphone pair geometries in inference. Real-data experiments with smartphone recordings of speech in interference demonstrate the network's generalization capability.",

    abstract = "Sound event detection is the task of identifying automatically the presence and temporal boundaries of sound events within an input audio stream. In the last years, deep learning methods have established themselves as the state-of-the-art approach for the task, using binary indicators during training to denote whether an event is active or inactive. However, such binary activity indicators do not fully describe the events, and estimating the envelope of the sounds could provide more precise modeling of their activity. This paper proposes to estimate the amplitude envelopes of target sound event classes in polyphonic mixtures. For training, we use the amplitude envelopes of the target sounds, calculated from mixture signals and, for comparison, from their isolated counterparts. The model is then used to perform envelope estimation and sound event detection. Results show that the envelope estimation allows good modeling of the sounds activity, with detection results comparable to current state-of-the art.",

    abstract = "The majority of sound scene analysis work focuses on one of two clearly defined tasks: acoustic scene classification or sound event detection. Whilst this separation of tasks is useful for problem definition, they inherently ignore some subtleties of the real-world, in particular how humans vary in how they describe a scene. Some will describe the weather and features within it, others will use a holistic descriptor like `park', and others still will use unique identifiers such as cities or names. In this paper, we undertake the task of automatic city classification to ask whether we can recognize a city from a set of sound scenes? In this problem each city has recordings from multiple scenes. We test a series of methods for this novel task and show that a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve accuracy of 50%. This is less than the acoustic scene classification task baseline in the DCASE 2018 ASC challenge on the same data. A simple adaptation to the class labels of pairing city labels with grouped scenes, accuracy increases to 52%, closer to the simpler scene classification task. Finally we also formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework and achieve an accuracy of 56%, outperforming the aforementioned approaches.",

The creation of a dataset for this task requires a considerable amount of work, rendering the crowdsourcing a very attractive option. In this paper we present a three steps based framework for crowdsourcing an audio captioning dataset, based on concepts and practises followed for the creation of widely used image captioning and machine translations datasets. During the first step initial captions are gathered. A grammatically corrected and/or rephrased version of each initial caption is obtained in second step. Finally, the initial and edited captions are rated, keeping the top ones for the produced dataset. We objectively evaluate the impact of our framework during the process of creating an audio captioning dataset, in terms of diversity and amount of typographical errors in the obtained captions. The obtained results show that the resulting dataset has less typographical errors than the initial captions, and on average each sound in the produced dataset has captions with a Jaccard similarity of 0.24, roughly equivalent to two ten-word captions having in common four words with the same root, indicating that the captions are dissimilar while they still contain some of the same information.",

In real-life recordings, the sound events exhibit some temporal structure: for instance, a {"}car horn{"} will likely be followed by a {"}car passing by{"}. While this temporal structure is widely exploited in sequence prediction tasks (e.g., in machine translation), where language models (LM) are exploited, it is not satisfactorily modeled in SED. In this work we propose a method which allows a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn an LM for the SED task. The method conditions the input of the RNN with the activities of classes at the previous time step. We evaluate our method using F1 score and error rate (ER) over three different and publicly available datasets; the TUT-SED Synthetic 2016 and the TUT Sound Events 2016 and 2017 datasets.

We examine the mapping functions of neural networks based on the denoising autoencoder (DAE) model that are conditioned on the mixture magnitude spectra. To approximate the mapping functions, we propose an algorithm inspired by the knowledge distillation, denoted the neural couplings algorithm (NCA). The NCA yields a matrix that expresses the mapping of the mixture to the target source magnitude information. Using the NCA, we examine the mapping functions of three fundamental DAE-based models in music source separation; one with single-layer encoder and decoder, one with multi-layer encoder and single-layer decoder, and one using skip-filtering connections (SF) with a single-layer encoding and decoding. We first train these models with realistic data to estimate the singing voice magnitude spectra from the corresponding mixture. We then use the optimized models and test spectral data as input to the NCA. Our experimental findings show that approaches based on the DAE model learn scalar filtering operators, exhibiting a predominant diagonal structure in their corresponding mapping functions, limiting the exploitation of inter-frequency structure of music data. In contrast, skip-filtering connections are shown to assist the DAE model in learning filtering operators that exploit richer inter-frequency structures.",

It consists of three parts: a) the usage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks instead of their bidirectional variant used in the original work, b) using a short synthesis window (here 8 ms) required for low-latency operation, and, c) using a buffer in the beginning of audio mixture to estimate cluster centres corresponding to constituent speakers which are then utilized to separate speakers within the rest of the signal. The buffer duration would serve as an initialization phase after which the system is capable of operating with 8 ms algorithmic latency. We evaluate our proposed approach on two-speaker mixtures from Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus. We observe that the use of LSTM yields around one dB lower SDR as compared to the baseline bidirectional LSTM in terms of source to distortion ratio (SDR). Moreover, using an 8 ms synthesis window instead of 32 ms degrades the separation performance by around 2.1 dB as compared to the baseline. Finally, we also report separation performance with different buffer durations noting that separation can be achieved even for buffer duration as low as 300 ms.",

In this paper, we present three tasks, including the datasets and baseline systems, and analyze the challenge entries for each task. We observe the popularity of methods using deep neural networks, and the still widely used mel frequency-based representations, with only few approaches standing out as radically different. Analysis of the systems behavior reveals that task-specific optimization has a big role in producing good performance; however, often this optimization closely follows the ranking metric, and its maximization/minimization does not result in universally good performance. We also introduce the calculation of confidence intervals based on a jackknife resampling procedure to perform statistical analysis of the challenge results. The analysis indicates that while the 95{\%} confidence intervals for many systems overlap, there are significant differences in performance between the top systems and the baseline for all tasks.",

abstract = "The objective of this thesis is to develop novel classiﬁcation and feature learning techniques for the task of sound event detection (SED) in real-world environments. Throughout their lives, humans experience a consistent learning process on how to assign meanings to sounds. Thanks to this, most of the humans can easily recognize the sound of a thunder, dog bark, door bell, bird singing etc. In this work, we aim to develop systems that can automatically detect the sound events commonly present in our daily lives. Such systems can be utilized in e.g. contextaware devices, acoustic surveillance, bio-acoustical and healthcare monitoring, and smart-home cities.

In this thesis, we propose to apply the modern machine learning methods called deep learning for SED. The relationship between the commonly used timefrequency representations for SED (such as mel spectrogram and magnitude spectrogram) and the target sound event labels are highly complex. Deep learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNN) utilize a layered structure of units to extract features from the given sound representation input with increased abstraction at each layer. This increases the network’s capacity to eﬃciently learn the highly complex relationship between the sound representation and the target sound event labels. We found that the proposed DNN approach performs signiﬁcantly better than the established classiﬁer techniques for SED such as Gaussian mixture models.

In a time-frequency representation of an audio recording, a sound event can often be recognized as a distinct pattern that may exhibit shifts in both dimensions. The intra-class variability of the sound events may cause to small shifts in the frequency domain content, and the time domain shift results from the fact that a sound event can occur at any time for a given audio recording. We found that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are useful to learn shift-invariant ﬁlters that are essential for robust modeling of sound events. In addition, we show that recurrent neural networks (RNN) are eﬀective in modeling the long-term temporal characteristics of the sound events. Finally, we combine the convolutional and recurrent layers in a single classiﬁer called convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN), which emphasizes the beneﬁts of both and provides state-of-the-art results in multiple SED benchmark datasets.

Aside from learning the mappings between the time-frequency representations and the sound event labels, we show that deep learning methods can also be utilized to learn a direct mapping between the the target labels and a lower level representation such as the magnitude spectrogram or even the raw audio signals. In this thesis, the feature learning capabilities of the deep learning methods and the empirical knowledge on the human auditory perception are proposed to be integrated through the means of layer weight initialization with ﬁlterbank coeﬃcients. This results with an optimal, ad-hoc ﬁlterbank that is obtained through gradient based optimization of the original coeﬃcients to improve the SED performance.",

Classical source models in the short-term Fourier transform domain use circularly-symmetric Gaussian or Poisson random variables. This is equivalent to assuming that the phase of each source is uniformly distributed, which is not suitable for exploiting the underlying structure of the phase. Drawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian source model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us to favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov chain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex Itakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of non-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a distortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which preserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables one to account for some phase constraints. We derive a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Experiments conducted on a musical source separation task in a semi-informed setting show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art phase-aware separation techniques.",

The proposed method allows separation of reverberated sources from the far-field mixture given that their close-field signals are available. The evaluation is based on measuring unmixing performance (removal of reverberated source) using objective separation criteria calculated between the ground truth recording of the preserved sources and the unmixing result obtained with the proposed algorithm.

    abstract = "This paper presents novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms for estimating the nonnegative matrix factorization model with Itakura-Saito divergence. Indeed, the common EM-based approach exploits the space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) variant of EM but it usually performs worse than the conventional multiplicative algorithm. We propose to explore more exhaustively those algorithms, in particular the choice of the methodology (standard EM or SAGE variant) and the latent variable set (full or reduced). We then derive four EM-based algorithms, among which three are novel. Speech separation experiments show that one of those novel algorithms using a standard EM methodology and a reduced set of latent variables outperforms its SAGE variants and competes with the conventional multiplicative algorithm.",

    abstract = "This paper presents an algorithm for multichannel sound source separation using explicit modeling of level and time differences in source spatial covariance matrices (SCM). We propose a novel SCM model in which the spatial properties are modeled by the weighted sum of direction of arrival (DOA) kernels. DOA kernels are obtained as the combination of phase and level difference covariance matrices representing both time and level differences between microphones for a grid of predefined source directions. The proposed SCM model is combined with the NMF model for the magnitude spectrograms. Opposite to other SCM models in the literature, in this work, source localization is implicitly defined in the model and estimated during the signal factorization. Therefore, no localization pre-processing is required. Parameters are estimated using complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) with both Euclidean distance and Itakura Saito divergence. Separation performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the two-channel SiSEC development dataset and four channels signals recorded in a regular room with moderate reverberation. Finally, a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods is performed, showing better achieved separation performance in terms of SIR and perceptual measures.",

    abstract = "In this paper, we study statistical models for the phase of the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) of audio signals. STFT phase globally appears as uniformly distributed, which has led researchers in this field to model it as a uniform random variable. However, some information about the phase can be obtained from a sinusoidal model, which reveals its local structure. Therefore, we propose to model the phase with a von Mises (VM) random variable, which enables us to favor the sinusoidal model-based phase value. We estimate the distribution parameters and we validate this model on real audio data. In particular, we observe that both models (uniform and VM) are relevant from a statistical perspective but they convey different information about the phase (global vs. local). We also apply this VM model to an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous approaches.",

    abstract = "Complex nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for decomposing audio spectrograms while accounting for some phase information in the time-frequency domain. While its estimation was originally based on the Euclidean distance, in this paper we propose to extend it to any beta-divergence, a family of functions widely used in audio to estimate NMF. To this end, we introduce the beta-divergence in a heuristic fashion within a phase-aware probabilistic model. Estimating this model results in performing an NMF with Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence on a quantity called the phase-corrected posterior power of the sources, which is both phase-dependent and nonnegative-valued. Therefore, we replace IS with the beta-divergence, so that the factorization uses an optimal distortion metric and remains phase-aware. Even though by doing so we loose theoretical convergence guarantees, the resulting algorithm demonstrates its potential for an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous complex NMFs approaches.",

    abstract = "Sound event detection systems typically consist of two stages: Extracting hand-crafted features from the raw audio waveform, and learning a mapping between these features and the target sound events using a classifier. Recently, the focus of sound event detection research has been mostly shifted to the latter stage using standard features such as mel spectrogram as the input for classifiers such as deep neural networks. In this work, we utilize end-to-end approach and propose to combine these two stages in a single deep neural network classifier. The feature extraction over the raw waveform is conducted by a feedforward layer block, whose parameters are initialized to extract the time-frequency representations. The feature extraction parameters are updated during training, resulting with a representation that is optimized for the specific task. This feature extraction block is followed by (and jointly trained with) a convolutional recurrent network, which has recently given state-of-the-art results in many sound recognition tasks. The proposed system does not outperform a convolutional recurrent network with fixed hand-crafted features. The final magnitude spectrum characteristics of the feature extraction block parameters indicate that the most relevant information for the given task is contained in 0 - 3 kHz frequency range, and this is also supported by the empirical results on the SED performance.",

    abstract = "In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network for joint sound event localization and detection (SELD) of multiple overlapping sound events in three-dimensional (3D) space. The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values, reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in comparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of overlapping sound events.",

The resulting magnitude estimate is then combined with the mixture's phase to retrieve the complex-valued STFT of the voice, which is further synthesized into a time-domain signal. However, when the sources overlap in time and frequency, the STFT phase of the voice differs from the mixture's phase, which results in interference and artifacts in the estimated signals. In this paper, we investigate on recent phase recovery algorithms that tackle this issue and can further enhance the separation quality. These algorithms exploit phase constraints that originate from a sinusoidal model or from consistency , a property that is a direct consequence of the STFT redundancy.

    abstract = "Public evaluation campaigns and datasets promote active development in target research areas, allowing direct comparison of algorithms. The second edition of the challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2016) has offered such an opportunity for development of state-of-the-art methods, and succeeded in drawing together a large number of participants from academic and industrial backgrounds. In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present in detail each task and analyse the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.",

The encoder is a multi-layered, bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the decoder a multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected layers with shared weights between timesteps.

While traditional approaches do not exploit phase constraints that originate from signal modeling, some prior information about the phase can be obtained from sinusoidal modeling. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic mixture model which allows us to incorporate such phase priors within a source separation framework. While the magnitudes are estimated beforehand, the phases are modeled by Von Mises random variables whose location parameters are the phase priors. We then approximate this non-tractable model by an anisotropic Gaussian model, in which the phase dependencies are preserved. This enables us to derive an MMSE estimator of the sources which optimally combines Wiener filtering and prior phase estimates. Experimental results highlight the potential of incorporating phase priors into mixture models for separating overlapping components in complex audio mixtures.",

It is used by the audio engineering community for decades for audio recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the recording practice itself. But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For all the above cases we calculate the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric. The results obtained clearly demonstrate an optimum close-miking performance that matches the current empirical knowledge of professional audio recording.",

We propose a novel multichannel NMF model with time-varying mixing of the sources denoted by spatial covariance matrices (SCM) and provide update equations for optimizing model parameters minimizing squared Frobenius norm. The SCMs of the model are obtained based on estimated directions of arrival of tracked sources at each time frame. The evaluation is based on established objective separation criteria and using real recordings of two and three simultaneous moving sound sources. The compared methods include conventional beamforming and ideal ratio mask separation. The proposed method is shown to exceed the separation quality of other evaluated blind approaches according to all measured quantities. Additionally, we evaluate the method's susceptibility towards tracking errors by comparing the separation quality achieved using annotated ground truth source trajectories.",

New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||",

In the evaluation, average results over 10 fold Monte Carlo cross-validation with 80% training and 20% test split were reported. Highest performance was achieved using CNN, with 92% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 94% accuracy, and 0.983 area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AROC). Results showed a 6% average increase of performance of the CNN over SVM and greater robustness, and similar performance to ambient microphones.",

The spectral representations are then used to derive time-frequency masks. In this work we introduce a method to directly learn time-frequency masks from an observed mixture magnitude spectrum. We employ recurrent neural networks and train them using prior knowledge only for the magnitude spectrum of the target source. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we focus on the task of singing voice separation. The results from an objective evaluation show that our proposed method provides comparable results to deep learning based methods which operate over complicated signal representations. Compared to previous methods that approximate time-frequency masks, our method has increased performance of signal to distortion ratio by an average of 3.8 dB.",

The baseline is based on a supervised classification approach which is composed by training and testing stages. The training stage is based on the construction of a statistical model capable to describe each of the environmental classes that will be used during the training stage. The innovation part has the goal of clustering the available observations so that each class is divided into some subclasses. The models will be created for each subclass. These models describe acoustic environments in more detail, which allows achieving higher level of accuracy.
The system has preserved its previous stages and the method used for the clustering has been k-means. The experiments have been performed firstly with the development dataset and the results obtained have been validated with the challenge dataset aiming to verify that the system is capable to generalize its results. Three different approaches have been tested: First, the number of clusters has been set invariant for all the classes. Values 2, 3, 5 and 10 have been tested. The performance has increased 2% for 2 clusters. Second, the number of clusters has been selected manually choosing the values that proved to provide better performance for each class during the development stage. The performance has increased 2.3% with respect to the baseline. Third approach is more sophisticated and includes cluster evaluation based on BD and CH indices. This method allows calculating the number of clusters for each class automatically. It has improved the performance in 2% with respect to the baseline.",

The new method, called binary nonnegative matrix deconvolution (BNMD), is developed and used to discover patterns from magnitude-scale spectrograms. The BNMD models an audio spectrogram as a sum of delayed patterns having binary gains (activations). Only small subsets of patterns can be active for a given spectrogram excerpt. The proposed method was applied to speaker identification and separation tasks. The experimental results show that dictionaries obtained by the BNMD bring much higher speaker identification accuracies averaged over a range of SNRs from -6 dB to 9 dB (91.3%) than the NMD-based dictionaries (37.8-75.4%). The BNMD also gives a benefit over dictionaries obtained using vector quantization (87.8%). For bigger dictionaries the difference between the BNMD and the vector quantization (VQ) is getting smaller. For the speech separation task the BNMD dictionary gave a slight improvement over the VQ.",

In this paper a feasibility study is presented on a new monitoring concept in which an acoustic pattern classification algorithm running in a wireless sensor is used to automatically assign the measured sound level to different noise sources. A supervised noise source classifier is learned from a small amount of manually annotated recordings and the learned classifier is used to automatically detect the activity of target noise source in the presence of interfering noise sources. The sensor is based on an inexpensive credit-card-sized single-board computer with a microphone and associated electronics and wireless connectivity. The measurement results and the noise source information are transferred from the sensors scattered around the measurement site to a cloud service and a noise portal is used to visualise the measurements to users. The proposed noise monitoring concept was piloted on a rock crushing site. The system ran reliably over 50 days on site, during which it was able to recognise more than 90% of the noise sources correctly. The pilot study shows that the proposed noise monitoring system can reduce the amount of required human validation of the sound level measurements when the target noise source is clearly defined.",

We present the first acoustic self-localization scheme that is passive, and is capable of operating when sensors are moving, and possibly unsynchronized. As a result, the relative microphone positions are obtained and therefore an ad hoc microphone array has been established. The proposed system takes advantage of the knowledge that a device is worn by its user e.g. attached to his/her clothing. A user here acts as a sound source and the sensor is the user-worn microphone. Such an entity is referred to as a node. Node-related spatial information is obtained from Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimated from audio captured by the nodes. Kalman filtering is used for node tracking and prediction of spatial information during periods of node silence. Finally, the node positions are recovered using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The only information required by the proposed system is observations of sounds produced by the nodes such as speech to localize the moving nodes. The general framework for acoustic self-localization is presented followed by an implementation to demonstrate the concept. Real data collected by off-the-shelf equipment is used to evaluate the positioning accuracy of nodes in contrast to image based method. The presented system achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 cm in an acoustic laboratory.",

Does the emotional impact arise from the fact that the listener recognizes that a gun produced the sound (semantic content) or does it arise from the attributes of the sound created by the firing gun? This research explores the relation between the semantic similarity of the sound events and the elicited emotions. Results indicate that the semantic content seems to have a limited role in the conformation of the listener’s affective states. However, when the semantic content is matched to specific areas in the Arousal-Valence space or when the source’s spatial position is considered, the effect of the semantic content is higher, especially for the cases of medium to low valence and medium to high arousal or when the sound source is at the lateral positions of the listener’s head.",

One of the key factors of this improvement is the capability of deep architectures to automatically learn higher levels of acoustic features in each layer. In this work, we aim to combine the feature learning capabilities of deep architectures with the empirical knowledge of human perception. We use the first layer of a deep neural network to learn a mapping from a high-resolution magnitude spectrum to smaller amount of frequency bands, which effectively learns a filterbank for the sound event detection task. We initialize the first hidden layer weights to match with the perceptually motivated mel filterbank magnitude response. We also integrate this initialization scheme with context windowing by using an appropriately constrained deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method does not only result with better detection accuracy, but also provides insight on the frequencies deemed essential for better discrimination of given sound events.",

With respect to the genre and style of the audio content, the parameters of these techniques are controlled by a mastering engineer, in order to process the original audio material. This operation relies on musical and perceptually pleasing facets of the perceived acoustic characteristics, transmitted from the audio material under the mastering process. Modeling such dynamic operations, which involve adaptation regarding the audio content, becomes vital in automated applications since it significantly affects the overall performance. In this work we present a system capable of modelling such behavior focusing on the automatic dynamic range compression. It predicts frequency coefficients that allow the dynamic range compression, via a trained deep neural network, and applies them to unmastered audio signal served as input. Both dynamic range compression and the prediction of the corresponding frequency coefficients take place inside the time-frequency domain, using magnitude spectra acquired from a critical band filter bank, similar to humans’ peripheral auditory system. Results from conducted listening tests, incorporating professional music producers and audio mastering engineers, demonstrate on average an equivalent performance compared to professionally mastered audio content. Improvements were also observed when compared to relevant and commercial software.",

abstract = "The increasing use of mobile technology in everyday life has aroused interest into developing new ways of utilizing the data collected by devices such as mobile phones and wearable devices. Acoustic sensors can be used to localize sound sources if the positions of spatially separate sensors are known or can be determined. However, the process of determining the 3D coordinates by manual measurements is tedious especially with increasing number of sensors. Therefore, the localization process has to be automated. Satellite based positioning is imprecise for many applications and requires line-of-sight to the sky. This thesis studies localization methods for wireless acoustic sensor networks and the process is called self-localization.This thesis focuses on self-localization from sound, and therefore the term acoustic is used. Furthermore, the development of the methods aims at utilizing ad hoc sensor networks, which means that the sensors are not necessarily installed in the premises like meeting rooms and other purpose-built spaces, which often have dedicated audio hardware for spatial audio applications. Instead of relying on such spaces and equipment, mobile devices are used, which are combined to form sensor networks.For instance, a few mobile phones laid on a table can be used to create a sensor network built for an event and it is inherently dismantled once the event is over, which explains the use of the term ad hoc. Once positions of the devices are estimated, the network can be used for spatial applications such as sound source localization and audio enhancement via spatial ﬁltering. The main purpose of this thesis is to present the methods for self-localization of such an ad hoc acoustic sensor network. Using off-the-shelf ad hoc devices to establish sensor networks enables implementation of many spatial algorithms basically in any environment.Several acoustic self-localization methods have been introduced over the years. However, they often rely on specialized hardware and calibration signals. This thesis presents methods that are passive and utilize environmental sounds such as speech from which, by using time delay estimation, the spatial information of the sensor network can be determined. Many previous self-localization methods assume that audio captured by the sensors is synchronized. This assumption cannot be made in an ad hoc sensor network, since the different sensors are unaware of each other without speciﬁc signaling that is not available without special arrangement.The methods developed in this thesis are evaluated with simulations and real data recordings. Scenarios in which the targets of positioning are stationary and in motion are studied. The real world recordings are made in closed spaces such as meeting rooms. The targets are approximately 1 – 5 meters apart. The positioning accuracy is approximately ﬁve centimeters in a stationary scenario, and ten centimeters in a moving-target scenario on average. The most important result of this thesis is presenting the ﬁrst self-localization method that uses environmental sounds and off-the-shelf unsynchronized devices, and allows the targets of self-localization to move.",

abstract = "In this thesis we investigate the use of deep neural networks applied to the ﬁeld of computational audio scene analysis, in particular to acoustic scene classiﬁcation. This task concerns the recognition of an acoustic scene, like a park or a home, performed by an artiﬁcial system. In our work we examine the use of deep models aiming to give a contribution in one of their use cases which is, in our opinion, one of the most poorly explored.
The neural architecture we propose in this work is a convolutional neural network speciﬁcally designed to work on a time-frequency audio representation known as log-mel spectrogram. The network output is an array of prediction scores, each of which is associated with one class of a set of 15 predeﬁned classes. In addition, the architecture features batch normalization, a recently proposed regularization technique used to enhance the network performance and to speed up its training. 
We also investigate the use of different audio sequence lengths as classiﬁcation unit for our network. Thanks to these experiments we observe that, for our artiﬁcial system, the recognition of long sequences is not easier than of medium-length sequences, hence highlighting a counterintuitive behaviour. Moreover, we introduce a training procedure which aims to make the best of small datasets by using all the labeled data available for the network training. This procedure, possible under particular circumstances, constitutes a trade-off between an accurate training stop and an increased data representation available to the network. Finally, we compare our model to other systems, proving that its recognition ability can outperform either other neural architectures as well as other state-of-the-art statistical classiﬁers, like support vector machines and Gaussian mixture models.
The proposed system reaches good accuracy scores on two different databases collected in 2013 and 2016. The best accuracy scores, obtained according to two cross-validation setups, are 77% and 79% respectively. These scores constitute a 22% and 6.1% accuracy increment with respect to the correspondent baselines published together with datasets.",

The approach specifically addresses the challenging case of separation where no training data are available. By representing mixtures in the modulation spectrogram (MS) domain, we exploit underlying similarities in patterns present across frequency. A three-dimensional tensor factorization is able to take advantage of these redundant patterns, and is used to separate a mixture into an approximated sum of components by minimizing a divergence cost. Furthermore, we show that the basic tensor factorization can be extended with convolution in time being used to improve separation results and provide update rules to learn components in such a manner. Following factorization, sources are reconstructed in the audio domain from estimated components using a novel approach based on reconstruction masks that are learned using MS activations, and then applied to a mixture spectrogram. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior separation performance to a spectrally based nonnegative matrix factorization approach, in terms of source-to-distortion ratio. We also compare separation with the perceptually motivated interference-related perceptual score metric and identify cases with higher performance.",

The time-frequency (T-F) masking technique applies a real-valued (or binary) mask on top of the signal's spectrum to filter out unwanted components. The practical difficulty lies in the mask estimation. Often, using efficient masks engineered for separation performance leads to presence of unwanted musical noise artifacts in the separated signal. This lowers the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the output. Microphone arrays have been long studied for processing of distant speech. This work uses a feed-forward neural network for mapping microphone array's spatial features into a T-F mask. Wiener filter is used as a desired mask for training the neural network using speech examples in simulated setting. The T-F masks predicted by the neural network are combined to obtain an enhanced separation mask that exploits the information regarding interference between all sources. The final mask is applied to the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) output. The algorithm's objective separation capability in conjunction with the separated speech intelligibility is tested with recorded speech from distant talkers in two rooms from two distances. The results show improvement in instrumental measure for intelligibility and frequency-weighted SNR over complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation approach, spatial sound source separation, and conventional beamforming methods such as the DSB and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR).",

Although many existing works focus on emotion recognition from music, there seems to be a relative scarcity of research on emotion recognition from general sounds. One of the key characteristics of sound events is the sound source spatial position, i.e. the location of the source relatively to the acoustic receiver. Existing studies that aim to investigate the relation of the latter source placement and the elicited emotions are limited to distance, front and back spatial localization and/or specific emotional categories. In this paper we analytically investigate the effect of the source angular position on the listener's emotional state, modeled in the well-established valence/arousal affective space. Towards this aim, we have developed an annotated sound events dataset using binaural processed versions of the available International Affective Digitized Sound (IADS) sound events library. All subjective affective annotations were obtained using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) approach. Preliminary results obtained by processing these annotation scores are likely to indicate a systematic change in the listener affective state as the sound source angular position changes. This trend is more obvious when the sound source is located outside of the visible field of the listener.",

abstract = "This thesis studies several data decomposition algorithms for obtaining an object-based representation of an audio signal. The estimation of the representation parameters are coupled with audio-specific criteria, such as the spectral redundancy, sparsity, perceptual relevance and spatial position of sounds. The objective is to obtain an audio signal representation that is composed of meaningful entities called audio objects that reflect the properties of real-world sound objects and events. The estimation of the object-based model is based on magnitude spectrogram redundancy using non-negative matrix factorization with extensions to multichannel and complex-valued data. The benefits of working with object-based audio representations over the conventional time-frequency bin-wise processing are studied. The two main applications of the object-based audio representations proposed in this thesis are spatial audio coding and sound source separation from multichannel microphone array recordings. In the proposed spatial audio coding algorithm, the audio objects are estimated from the multichannel magnitude spectrogram. The audio objects are used for recovering the content of each original channel from a single downmixed signal, using time-frequency filtering. The perceptual relevance of modeling the audio signal is considered in the estimation of the parameters of the object-based model, and the sparsity of the model is utilized in encoding its parameters. Additionally, a quantization of the model parameters is proposed that reflects the perceptual relevance of each quantized element. The proposed object-based spatial audio coding algorithm is evaluated via listening tests and comparing the overall perceptual quality to conventional time-frequency block-wise methods at the same bitrates. The proposed approach is found to produce comparable coding efficiency while providing additional functionality via the object-based coding domain representation, such as the blind separation of the mixture of sound sources in the encoded channels. For the sound source separation from multichannel audio recorded by a microphone array, a method combining an object-based magnitude model and spatial covariance matrix estimation is considered. A direction of arrival-based model for the spatial covariance matrices of the sound sources is proposed. Unlike the conventional approaches, the estimation of the parameters of the proposed spatial covariance matrix model ensures a spatially coherent solution for the spatial parameterization of the sound sources. The separation quality is measured with objective criteria and the proposed method is shown to improve over the state-of-the-art sound source separation methods, with recordings done using a small microphone array.",

This thesis is part of a larger study whose objective is to analyze the acoustic properties of infant cry signals and use it for early assessment of neurological developmental issues in infants. 
This thesis deals with two research problems in the context of infant cry signals: audio segmentation of cry recordings in order to extract relevant acoustic parts, and fundamental frequency (F0) estimation of the extracted acoustic regions. The extracted acoustic regions are relevant for extracting parameters useful for drawing correlation with developmental outcomes of the infants. Fundamental frequency (F0) is one such potentially useful parameter whose variation has been found to correlate with cases of neurological insults in infants. The cry recordings are captured in realistic hospital environments under varied contexts like infant crying out of hunger, pain etc. A hidden Markov model (HMM) based audio segmentation system is proposed. The performance of the system is evaluated for different configurations of HMM states, number of component Gaussians, and using different combinations of audio features. Frame based accuracy of 88.5 % is achieved. YIN algorithm, a popular F0 estimation algorithm, is utilized to deal with the fundamental frequency estimation problem, and a method to discard unreliable F0 estimates is suggested. The statistics associated with distribution of F0 estimates corresponding to different components of cry signals are reported. 
This work would be followed up to find meaningful correlations between extracted F0 estimates and developmental outcomes of the infants. Moreover, other acoustic parameters would also be investigated for the same purpose.

abstract = "The objective of this thesis is to investigate how a deep learning model called recurrent neural network (RNN) performs in the task of detecting overlapping sound events in real life environments. Examples of such sound events include dog barking, footsteps, and crowd applauding. When several sound sources are active simultaneously, as it is often the case in everyday contexts, identifying individual sound events from their polyphonic mixture is a challenging task. Other factors such as noise and distortions contribute to making even more difficult to explicitly implement a computer program to solve the detection task.
We present an approach to polyphonic sound event detection in real life recordings based on a RNN architecture called bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM). A multilabel BLSTM RNN is trained to map the time-frequency representation of a mixture signal consisting of sounds from multiple sources, to binary activity indicators of each event class. Our method is tested on two large databases of recordings, both containing sound events from more than 60 different classes, and in one case from 10 different everyday contexts. Furthermore, in order to reduce overfitting we propose to use several data augmentation techniques: time stretching, sub-frame time shifting, and block mixing.
The proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, despite using half of the parameters, and the results are further largely improved using the block mixing data augmentation technique. Overall, for the first dataset our approach reports an average F1-score of 65.5% on 1 second blocks and 64.7% on single frames, a relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art approach of 6.8% and 15.1% respectively. For the second dataset our system reports an average F1- score of 84.4% on 1 second blocks and 85.1% on single frames, a relative improvement over the baseline approach of 38.4% and 35.9% respectively.",

    abstract = "Exemplar-based speech enhancement systems work by decomposing the noisy speech as a weighted sum of speech and noise exemplars stored in a dictionary and use the resulting speech and noise estimates to obtain a time-varying filter in the full-resolution frequency domain to enhance the noisy speech. To obtain the decomposition, exemplars sampled in lower dimensional spaces are preferred over the full-resolution frequency domain for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize to unseen cases. But the resulting filter may be sub-optimal as the mapping of the obtained speech and noise estimates to the full-resolution frequency domain yields a low-rank approximation. This paper proposes an efficient way to directly compute the full-resolution frequency estimates of speech and noise using coupled dictionaries: an input dictionary containing atoms from the desired exemplar space to obtain the decomposition and a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars from the full-resolution frequency domain. We also introduce modulation spectrogram features for the exemplar-based tasks using this approach. The proposed system was evaluated for various choices of input exemplars and yielded improved speech enhancement performances on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 databases. We further show that the proposed approach also results in improved word error rates (WERs) for the speech recognition tasks using HMM-GMM and deep-neural network (DNN) based systems.",

At signal-to-noise ratios below 0 dB, a majority of features may become corrupted, severely degrading the performance of classifiers built upon clean observations of a target class. As the energy and complexity of competing sources increase, their explicit modelling becomes integral for successful detection and classification of target speech. We have previously demonstrated how non-negative compositional modelling in a spectrogram space is suitable for robust recognition of speech and speakers even at low SNRs. In this work, the sparse coding approach is extended to cover the whole separation and classification chain to recognise the speaker of short utterances in difficult noise environments. A convolutive matrix factorisation and coding system is evaluated on 2nd CHiME Track 1 data. Over 98% average speaker recognition accuracy is achieved for shorter than three second utterances at +9 ... -6 dB SNR, illustrating the system's performance in challenging conditions.",

In a similar way, we have the ability to recognize di erent speakers, despite the linguistic content of the speech. Additionally to the voice individuality of the speaker, the particular prosody of speech involves relevant information concerning the identity, age, social group or economical status of the speaker, helping us identify the person to whom we are talking without seeing the speaker.
Voice conversion systems deal with the conversion of a speech signal to sound as if it was uttered by another speaker. It has been an important amount of work in the conversion of the timber of the voice, the spectral features, meanwhile the conversion of pitch and the way it temporarily evolves, modeling the speaker dependent prosody, is mostly achieved by just controlling the level and range.
This thesis focuses on prosody conversion, proposing an approach based on a wavelet transformation of the pitch contours. It has been performed a study of the wavelet domain, discerning among the di erent timing of the prosodic events, thus allowing an improved modeling of them. Consequently, the prosody conversion is achieved in the wavelet domain, using regression techniques originally developed for the spectral features conversion, in voice conversion systems.",

In everyday life, vocal interaction with people often implies emotions as an intrinsic part of the conversation to a greater or lesser extent. Thus, the inclusion of emotions in human-machine dialog systems is crucial to achieve an acceptable degree of naturalness in the communication. This thesis focuses on automatic emotion conversion of speech, a technique whose aim is to transform an utterance produced in neutral style to a certain emotion state in a speaker independent context. 
Conversion of emotions represents a challenge in the sense that emotions a affect significantly all the parts of the human vocal production system, and in the conversion process all these factors must be taken into account carefully. The techniques used in the literature are based on voice conversion approaches, with minor modifications to create the sensation of emotion. In this thesis, the idea of voice conversion systems is used as well, but the usual regression process is divided in a two-step procedure that provides additional speaker normalization to remove the intrinsic speaker dependency of this kind of systems, using vocal tract length normalization as a pre-processing technique. In addition, a new method to convert the duration trend of the utterance and the intonation contour is proposed, taking into account the contextual information.",

abstract = "Given an audio query, such as polyphonic musical piece, this thesis address the problem of retrieving a matching (similar) musical score data from a collection of musical scores. There are different techniques for measuring similarity between any musical piece such as metadata based similarity measure, collaborative filtering and content-based similarity measure. In this thesis, we use the information in the digital music itself for similarity measures and this technique is known as content-based similarity measure.
First we extract chroma features to represents musical segments. Chroma feature captures both melodic information and harmonic information and is robust to timbre variation. Tempo variation in the performance of a same song may cause dissimilarity between them. In order to address this issue we extract beat sequences and combine them with chroma features to obtain beat synchronous chroma features. 
Next, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. This algorithm first computes the DTW matrix between two feature sequences and calculates the cost of traversing from starting point to end point of the matrix. Minimum the cost value, more similar the musical segments are. The performance of DTW is improved by choosing suitable path constraints and path weight. Then, we implement LSH algorithm, which first indexes the data and then searches for a similar item. Processing time of LSH is shorter than that of DTW. For a smaller fragment of query audio, say 30 seconds, LSH outperformed DTW. Performance of LSH depends on the number of hash tables, number of projections per table and width of the projection. Both algorithms were applied in two types of data sets, RWC (where audio and midi are from the same source) and TUT (where audio and midi are from different sources). 
The contribution of this thesis is twofold. First we proposed a suitable feature representation of a musical segment for melodic similarity. And then we apply two different similarity measure algorithms and enhance their performances.

Popular online music recommendation services, including Spotify, Pandora and Last.FM use similarity-based approaches to generate recommendations. In this thesis work, I propose a personalized music recommendation approach that is based on probability estimation without any similarity calculation involved. In my system, each user gets a score for every piece of music. The score is obtained by combining two estimated probabilities of an acceptance. One estimated probability is based on the user’s preferences on timbres. Another estimated probability is the empirical acceptance rate of a music piece. The weighted arithmetic mean is evaluated to be the best performing combination function.
An online demonstration of my system is available at www.shuyang.eu/plg/. Demonstrating recommendation results show that the system works effectively. Through the algorithm analysis on my system, we can see that my system has good reactivity and scalability without suffering cold start problem. The accuracy of my recommendation approach is evaluated with Million Song Dataset. My system achieves a pairwise ranking accuracy of 0.592, which outperforms random ranking (0.5) and ranking by popularity (0.557). Unfortunately, I have not found any other music recommendation method evaluated with ranking accuracy yet.

A mixture signal is separated through factorisation of a feature-tensor representation, based on the modulation spectrogram. Harmonically related components tend to modulate in a similar fashion, and this redundancy of patterns can be isolated. This feature representation requires fewer parameters than spectrally based methods and so minimises overfitting. Following the tensor factorisation, the separated signals are reconstructed by learning appropriate Wiener-filter spectral parameters which have been constrained by activation parameters learned in the first stage. Strong results were obtained for two-speaker mixtures where source separation performance exceeded those used as benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed semi-supervised method outperformed both semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorisation and blind non-negative modulation spectrum tensor factorisation.",

abstract = "Audio information retrieval has been a popular research subject over the last decades
and being a subfield of this area, acoustic event classification has a considerable amount
of share in the research. In this thesis, acoustic event classification using deep neural networks is investigated. Neural networks have been used in several pattern recognition (both function approximation and classification) tasks. Due to their stacked, layer-wise
structure they have been proved to model highly nonlinear relations between inputs and outputs of a system with high performance. Even though several works imply an advantage of deeper networks over shallow ones in terms of recognition performance, advancements in training deep architectures were encountered only recently. These methods excel conventional methods such as HMMs and GMMs in terms of acoustic event classification performance.

In this thesis, effects of several NN classifier parameters such as number of hidden layers, number of units in hidden layers, batch size, learning rate etc. on classification accuracy are examined. Effects of implementation parameters such as types of features,
number of adjacent frames, number of most energetic frames etc. are also investigated. A classification accuracy of 61.1% has been achieved with certain parameter values. In the case of DBNs, An application of greedy, layer-wise, unsupervised training before
standard supervised training in order to initialize network weights in a better way,
provided a 2-4% improvement in classification performance. A NN that had randomly
initialized weights before supervised training was shown to be considerably powerful in terms of acoustic event classification tasks compared to conventional methods. DBNs have provided even better classification accuracies and justified its significant potential for further research on the topic.",

    abstract = "An approach is proposed for creating location-specific audio textures for virtual location-exploration services. The presented approach creates audio textures by processing a small amount of audio recorded at a given location, providing a cost-effective way to produce a versatile audio signal that characterizes the location. The resulting texture is non-repetitive and conserves the location-specific characteristics of the audio scene, without the need of collecting large amount of audio from each location. The method consists of two stages: analysis and synthesis. In the analysis stage, the source audio recording is segmented into homogeneous segments. In the synthesis stage, the audio texture is created by randomly drawing segments from the source audio so that the consecutive segments will have timbral similarity near the segment boundaries. Results obtained in listening experiments show that there is no statistically significant difference in the audio quality or location-specificity of audio when the created audio textures are compared to excerpts of the original recordings. Therefore, the proposed audio textures could be utilized in virtual location-exploration services. Examples of source signals and audio textures created from them are available at www.cs.tut.fi/~heittolt/audiotexture.",

abstract = "There are multiple sound events simultaneously occuring in a real-life audio recording collected e.g. at a busy street in rush hour. The events may include traffic noise, sound of rain, people talking etc. The humans are amazingly good at distinguishing these individual events, but as of yet, there is not any machine that can detect these events with (even close to) human accuracy. Polyphonic nature of the environmental audio recordings makes it hard to detect single sound events when many events are overlapping. With the gigantic audio database and state-of-the-art machine learning methods of the digital age, this is bound to change.

In this thesis, we use frequency-domain features to represent the audio input and multilabel deep neural networks (DNN) to detect multiple, simultaneous sound events in a real-life recording. We extract frequency-domain features from these recordings in short time frames. DNNs are artificial neural networks (ANN) with two or more hidden layers and they are especially good at modeling highly nonlinear relations and finding intermediate representations between system input and output. This is exactly the case in real-life sound event detection. Every feature extract is used as a training example and we train the neural network with these examples.

For the evaluation of this work, we focus on the performance of different topologies of DNNs used in this task. There are a large number of hyper parameters that define the structure of a DNN, such as the number of neurons in a layer, the learning rate used during learning, number of the hidden layers etc. The effects of each of these parameters are investigated in detail. A detection accuracy of 66.5% is achieved, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin.",

abstract = "Communication by speech is intrinsic for humans. Since the breakthrough of mobile devices and wireless communication, digital transmission of speech has become ubiquitous. Similarly distribution and storage of audio and video data has increased rapidly. However, despite being technically capable to record and process audio signals, only a fraction of digital systems and services are actually able to work with spoken input, that is, to operate on the lexical content of speech. One persistent obstacle for practical deployment of automatic speech recognition systems is inadequate robustness against noise and other interferences, which regularly corrupt signals recorded in real-world environments.

Speech and diverse noises are both complex signals, which are not trivially separable. Despite decades of research and a multitude of different approaches, the problem has not been solved to a sufficient extent. Especially the mathematically ill-posed problem of separating multiple sources from a single-channel input requires advanced models and algorithms to be solvable. One promising path is using a composite model of long-context atoms to represent a mixture of non-stationary sources based on their spectro-temporal behaviour. Algorithms derived from the family of non-negative matrix factorisations have been applied to such problems to separate and recognise individual sources like speech.

This thesis describes a set of tools developed for non-negative modelling of audio spectrograms, especially involving speech and real-world noise sources. An overview is provided to the complete framework starting from model and feature definitions, advancing to factorisation algorithms, and finally describing different routes for separation, enhancement, and recognition tasks. Current issues and their potential solutions are discussed both theoretically and from a practical point of view. The included publications describe factorisation-based recognition systems, which have been evaluated on publicly available speech corpora in order to determine the efficiency of various separation and recognition algorithms. Several variants and system combinations that have been proposed in literature are also discussed. The work covers a broad span of factorisation-based system components, which together aim at providing a practically viable solution to robust processing and recognition of speech in everyday situations.

Conventionally, the spectrum-related features take into account merely the magnitude information, whereas the phase is often overlooked due to the complications related to its interpretation. However, there is often additional information concealed in the phase, which could be beneficial for recognition. The APGD is an elegant approach to inferring phase information, which lacks of the issues related to interpreting the phase and does not require extensive parameter adjustment. Having shown applicability for speech-related problems, it is now explored in terms of instrument recognition. The evaluation is performed with various instrument sets and shows noteworthy absolute accuracy gains of up to 7% compared to the baseline mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) case. Combined with the MFCCs and with feature selection, APGD demonstrates superiority over the baseline with all the evaluated sets.",

In many conventional audio separation algorithms the source mixing parameter estimation is done separately for each frequency thus making them prone to errors and leading to suboptimal source estimates. In this paper we propose a SCM model which consists of a weighted sum of direction of arrival (DoA) kernels and estimate only the weights dependent on the source directions. In the proposed algorithm, the spatial properties of the sources become jointly optimized over all frequencies, leading to more coherent source estimates and mitigating the effect of spatial aliasing at high frequencies. The proposed SCM model is combined with a linear model for magnitudes and the parameter estimation is formulated in a complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) framework. Simulations consist of recordings done with a hand-held device sized array having multiple microphones embedded inside the device casing. Separation quality of the proposed algorithm is shown to exceed the performance of existing state of the art separation methods with two sources when evaluated by objective separation quality metrics.",

abstract = "Stochastic optimization (SO) represents a category of numerical optimization approaches, in which the search for the optimal solution involves randomness in a constructive manner. As shown also in this thesis, the stochastic optimization techniques and models have become an important and notable paradigm in a wide range of application areas, including transportation models, financial instruments, and network design. Stochastic optimization is especially developed for solving the problems that are either too difficult or impossible to solve analytically by deterministic optimization approaches. In this thesis, the focus is put on applying several stochastic optimization algorithms to two audio-specific application areas, namely sniper positioning and content-based audio classification and retrieval. In short, the first application belongs to an area of spatial audio, whereas the latter is a topic of machine learning and, more specifically, multimedia information retrieval. The SO algorithms considered in the thesis are particle filtering (PF), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA), which are extended, combined and applied to the specified problems in a novel manner. Based on their iterative and evolving nature, especially the PSO algorithms are often included to the category of evolutionary algorithms. Considering the sniper positioning application, in this thesis the PF and SA algorithms are employed to optimize the parameters of a mathematical shock wave model based on observed firing event wavefronts. Such an inverse problem is suitable for Bayesian approach, which is the main motivation for including the PF approach among the considered optimization methods. It is shown – also with SA – that by applying the stated shock wave model, the proposed stochastic parameter estimation approach provides statistically reliable and qualified results. The content-based audio classification part of the thesis is based on a dedicated framework consisting of several individual binary classifiers. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used within the framework, for which the parameters and network structures are optimized based the desired item outputs, i.e. the ground truth class labels. The optimization process is carried out using a multi-dimensional extension of the regular PSO algorithm (MD PSO). The audio retrieval experiments are performed in the context of feature generation (synthesis), which is an approach for generating new audio features/attributes based on some conventional features originally extracted from a particular audio database. Here the MD PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the feature generation process, wherein the dimensionality of the generated feature vector is also optimized. Both from practical perspective and the viewpoint of complexity theory, stochastic optimization techniques are often computationally demanding. Because of this, the practical implementations discussed in this thesis are designed as directly applicable to parallel computing. This is an important and topical issue considering the continuous increase of computing grids and cloud services. Indeed, many of the results achieved in this thesis are computed using a grid of several computers. Furthermore, since also personal computers and mobile handsets include an increasing number of processor cores, such parallel implementations are not limited to grid servers only.",

abstract = "During the past decades, many areas of speech processing have benefited from the vast increases in the available memory sizes and processing power. For example, speech recognizers can be trained with enormous speech databases and high-quality speech synthesizers can generate new speech sentences by concatenating speech units retrieved from a large inventory of speech data. However, even in today's world of ever-increasing memory sizes and computational resources, there are still lots of embedded application scenarios for speech processing techniques where the memory capacities and the processor speeds are very limited. Thus, there is still a clear demand for solutions that can operate with limited resources, e.g., on low-end mobile devices. This thesis introduces a new segmental parametric speech codec referred to as the VLBR codec. The novel proprietary sinusoidal speech codec designed for efficient speech storage is capable of achieving relatively good speech quality at compression ratios beyond the ones offered by the standardized speech coding solutions, i.e., at bitrates of approximately 1 kbps and below. The efficiency of the proposed coding approach is based on model simplifications, mode-based segmental processing, and the method of adaptive downsampling and quantization. The coding efficiency is also further improved using a novel flexible multi-mode matrix quantizer structure and enhanced dynamic codebook reordering. The compression is also facilitated using a new perceptual irrelevancy removal method. The VLBR codec is also applied to text-to-speech synthesis. In particular, the codec is utilized for the compression of unit selection databases and for the parametric concatenation of speech units. It is also shown that the efficiency of the database compression can be further enhanced using speaker-specific retraining of the codec. Moreover, the computational load is significantly decreased using a new compression-motivated scheme for very fast and memory-efficient calculation of concatenation costs, based on techniques and implementations used in the VLBR codec. Finally, the VLBR codec and the related speech synthesis techniques are complemented with voice conversion methods that allow modifying the perceived speaker identity which in turn enables, e.g., cost-efficient creation of new text-to-speech voices. The VLBR-based voice conversion system combines compression with the popular Gaussian mixture model based conversion approach. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed for converting the prosodic aspects of speech. The performance of the VLBR-based voice conversion system is also enhanced using a new approach for mode selection and through explicit control of the degree of voicing. The solutions proposed in the thesis together form a complete system that can be utilized in different ways and configurations. The VLBR codec itself can be utilized, e.g., for efficient compression of audio books, and the speech synthesis related methods can be used for reducing the footprint and the computational load of concatenative text-to-speech synthesizers to levels required in some embedded applications. The VLBR-based voice conversion techniques can be used to complement the codec both in storage applications and in connection with speech synthesis. It is also possible to only utilize the voice conversion functionality, e.g., in games or other entertainment applications.",

Conventionally, the spectrum-related features used in instrument recognition take into account merely the magnitude information, whereas the phase is often overlooked due to the complications related to its interpretation. However, there is often additional information concealed in the phase, which could be beneficial for recognition. The MODGDF is a method of incorporating phase information, which lacks of the issues related to phase unwrapping. Having shown its applicability for speech-related problems, it is now explored in terms of musical instrument recognition. The evaluation is performed on separate note recordings in various instrument sets, and combined with the conventional mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), MODGDF shows the noteworthy absolute accuracy gains of up to 5.1% compared to the baseline MFCCs case.",

Long-context speech and noise models, where phonetic patterns and noise events may span hundreds of milliseconds, have been found beneficial in such separation tasks. Thus far the majority of work employing non-negative matrix factorisation to long-context spectrogram separation has been conducted on small vocabulary tasks by exploiting large speech and noise dictionaries containing thousands of atoms. In this work we study whether the previously proposed factorisation methods are applicable to more natural speech and limited noise context while keeping the model sizes practically feasible.

Ad-hoc arrays hold a vast potential for audio applications, but they are inherently asynchronous, i.e., temporal offset exists in each channel, and furthermore the device locations are generally unknown. Therefore, the data is not directly suitable for traditional microphone array applications such as source localization and beamforming. This work presents a least squares method for temporal offset estimation of a static ad-hoc microphone array. The method utilizes the captured audio content without the need to emit calibration signals, provided that during the recording a sufficient amount of sound sources surround the array. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator is given and the effect of limited number of surrounding sources on the solution accuracy is investigated. A practical implementation is then presented using non-linear filtering with automatic parameter adjustment. Simulations over a range of reverberation and noise levels demonstrate the algorithm's robustness. Using smartphones an average RMS error of 3.5 samples (at 48 kHz) was reached when the algorithm's assumptions were met.",

    abstract = "The work presented in this article studies how the context information can be used in the automatic sound event detection process, and how the detection system can benefit from such information. Humans are using context information to make more accurate predictions about the sound events and ruling out unlikely events given the context. We propose a similar utilization of context information in the automatic sound event detection process. The proposed approach is composed of two stages: automatic context recognition stage and sound event detection stage. Contexts are modeled using Gaussian mixture models and sound events are modeled using three-state left-to-right hidden Markov models. In the first stage, audio context of the tested signal is recognized. Based on the recognized context, a context-specific set of sound event classes is selected for the sound event detection stage. The event detection stage also uses context-dependent acoustic models and count-based event priors. Two alternative event detection approaches are studied. In the first one, a monophonic event sequence is outputted by detecting the most prominent sound event at each time instance using Viterbi decoding. The second approach introduces a new method for producing polyphonic event sequence by detecting multiple overlapping sound events using multiple restricted Viterbi passes. A new metric is introduced to evaluate the sound event detection performance with various level of polyphony. This combines the detection accuracy and coarse time-resolution error into one metric, making the comparison of the performance of detection algorithms simpler. The two-step approach was found to improve the results substantially compared to the context-independent baseline system. In the block-level, the detection accuracy can be almost doubled by using the proposed context-dependent event detection.",

abstract = "The application areas of music information retrieval have been gaining popularity over the last decades. Musical instrument recognition is an example of a specific research topic in the field. In this thesis, semi-supervised learning techniques are explored in the context of musical instrument recognition. The conventional approaches employed for musical instrument recognition rely on annotated data, i.e., example recordings of the target instruments with associated information about the target labels in order to perform training. This implies a highly laborious and tedious work of manually annotating the collected training data. The semi-supervised methods enable incorporating additional unannotated data into training. Such data consists of merely the recordings of the instruments and is therefore significantly easier to acquire. Hence, these methods allow keeping the overall development cost at the same level while notably improving the performance of a system.

The implemented musical instrument recognition system utilises the mixture model semi-supervised learning scheme in the form of two EM-based algorithms. Furthermore, upgraded versions, namely, the additional labelled data weighting and class-wise retraining, for the improved performance and convergence criteria in terms of the particular classification scenario are proposed. The evaluation is performed on sets consisting of four and ten instruments and yields the overall average recognition accuracy rates of 95.3 and 68.4%, respectively. These correspond to the absolute gains of 6.1 and 9.7% compared to the initial, purely supervised cases. Additional experiments are conducted in terms of the effects of the proposed modifications, as well as the investigation of the optimal relative labelled dataset size. In general, the obtained performance improvement is quite noteworthy, and future research directions suggest to subsequently investigate the behaviour of the implemented algorithms along with the proposed and further extended approaches.",

The assumption behind the study is that acoustically similar events are annotated with semantically similar labels.

Unsupervised sound source separation into streams is used as a preprocessing step to minimize the interference of overlapping events.

We propose two iterative approaches based on EM algorithm to select the most likely stream to contain the target sound: one by selecting always the most likely stream and another one by gradually eliminating the most unlikely streams from the training. The approaches were evaluated with a database containing recordings from various contexts, against the baseline system trained without applying stream selection.

The separation is based on multiple acoustic source tracking (MAST) using Bayesian filtering and time–frequency masking. Measurements from three room environments with varying amounts of reverberation using two different designs of microphone arrays are used to evaluate the capability of the method to separate up to four simultaneously active speakers. Separation of moving talkers is also considered. Results are compared to two reference methods: ideal binary masking (IBM) and oracle tracking (O-T).

abstract = "Speaker identity plays an important role in human communication. In addition to the linguistic content, speech utterances contain acoustic information of the speaker characteristics. This thesis focuses on voice conversion, a technique that aims at changing the voice of one speaker (a source speaker) into the voice of another specific speaker (a target speaker) without changing the linguistic information. The relationship between the source and target speaker characteristics is learned from the training data. Voice conversion can be used in various applications and fields: text-to-speech systems, dubbing, speech-to-speech translation, games, voice restoration, voice pathology, etc. Voice conversion offers many challenges: which features to extract from speech, how to find linguistic correspondences (alignment) between source and target features, which machine learning techniques to use for creating a mapping function between the features of the speakers, and finally, how to make the desired modifications to the speech waveform. The features can be any parameters that describe the speech and the speaker identity, e.g. spectral envelope, excitation, fundamental frequency, and phone durations. The main focus of the thesis is on the design of suitable mapping techniques between frame-level source and target features, but also aspects related to parallel data alignment and prosody conversion are addressed. The perception of the quality and the success of the identity conversion are largely subjective. Conventional statistical techniques are able to produce good similarity between the original and the converted target voices but the quality is usually degraded. The objective of this thesis is to design conversion techniques that enable successful identity conversion while maintaining the original speech quality. Due to the limited amount of data, statistical techniques are usually utilized in extracting the mapping function. The most popular technique is based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). However, conventional GMM-based conversion suffers from many problems that result in degraded speech quality. The problems are analyzed in this thesis, and a technique that combines GMM-based conversion with partial least squares regression is introduced to alleviate these problems. Additionally, approaches to solve the time-independent mapping problem associated with many algorithms are proposed. The most significant contribution of the thesis is the proposed novel dynamic kernel partial least squares regression technique that allows creating a non-linear mapping function and improves temporal correlation. The technique is straightforward, efficient and requires very little tuning. It is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art GMM-based technique using both subjective and objective tests over a variety of speaker pairs. In addition, quality is further improved when aperiodicity and binary voicing values are predicted using the same technique. The vast majority of the existing voice conversion algorithms concern the transformation of the spectral envelopes. However, prosodic features, such as fundamental frequency movements and speaking rhythm, also contain important cues of identity. It is shown in the thesis that pure prosody alone can be used, to some extent, to recognize speakers that are familiar to the listeners. Furthermore, a prosody conversion technique is proposed that transforms fundamental frequency contours and durations at syllable level. The technique is shown to improve similarity to the target speaker’s prosody and reduce roboticness compared to a conventional frame-based conversion technique. Recently, the trend has shifted from text-dependent to text-independent use cases meaning that there is no parallel data available. The techniques proposed in the thesis currently assume parallel data, i.e. that the same texts have been spoken by both speakers. However, excluding the prosody conversion algorithm, the proposed techniques require no phonetic information and are applicable for a small amount of training data. Moreover, many text-independent approaches are based on extracting a sort of alignment as a pre-processing step. Thus the techniques proposed in the thesis can be exploited after the alignment process.",

abstract = "Voice conversion is a speech technology encompassing transformations applied to the speech signal with the purpose of changing the perceived speaker identity from a source voice to a desired target voice. The principal use of voice conversion is to enable synthesis systems to generate speech with customized voices without need for exhaustive recordings and processing. Voice conversion can be realized as a stand-alone task or alternatively, using adaptation techniques with HMM-based synthesis. Although there are many speaker-dependent voice characteristics, voice conversion deals mainly with those acoustic in nature such as the spectral characteristics and the fundamental frequency. In spite of the remarkable results achieved by the state of the art techniques, further challenges remain to be solved in all sub-areas of voice conversion in order to provide excellent quality and highly successful identity conversion. The objective of this thesis is to develop a stand-alone voice conversion system for coded speech and to propose solutions leading to better quality, versatility or efficiency compared to current techniques. The thesis is focused on the conversion of spectral envelopes but other sub-areas of voice conversion such as speech parameterization or alignment are also treated. The analysis-modification-synthesis system adopted in this thesis is based on a parametric speech model used in a real speech codec but also for the internal speech representation of a concatenative TTS system. This allows an easy integration of voice conversion with communications related and embedded applications developed for coded speech. The validity of this parameterization has been confirmed by using it in an actual voice conversion scheme. In addition, a voicing level control scheme, a speech enhancement technique and a method for automatic speech data collection have been proposed, all of them taking advantage of this parametric framework. The versatility of voice conversion systems depends on the characteristics imposed on the training data in order to properly estimate a conversion function. Depending on the characteristics of the training data different alignment strategies can be adopted. Although dynamic time warping (DTW) has become almost a standard for the alignment of parallel training data, a new soft alignment technique is proposed for the same purpose. This concept allows probabilistic one-to-many frame mapping and is proven valid in an experiment with an artificial example. For practical reasons the non-parallel case has been attracting increased interest lately. In this thesis, two techniques for text independent alignment are proposed. The first one is based on phonetic segmentation and temporal decomposition and was successfully used in a voice conversion application. The second method uses a TTS to break the non-parallel problem into two parallel conversions which concatenated realize the desired voice conversion. GMM-based techniques have been the most popular approach for the conversion of spectral envelopes in spite of their problems related to over-smoothing, over-fitting and the lack of temporal modeling. In order to address these issues and improve the GMM-based voice conversion, this thesis introduces several techniques. First, a new measure of the conversion accuracy is proposed, which can be easily computed from the GMM parameters, and is found to be in line with perceptual and objective metrics. The next technique combines a clustering and mode selection scheme with cluster-wise GMM modeling and is based on the observation that the mapping accuracy improves with the reduction of target data variance. The proposed technique is shown to outperform a comparable approach that uses voicing based clustering. A third technique can be used to adapt an existing well-trained conversion model to a new target speaker using a small amount of data. In a practical evaluation the adapted model outperformed an equivalent model trained exclusively on the reduced data. The continuity issue is addressed in a final idea proposed for future research. In general the spectral conversion techniques proposed in the literature have been subject to a tradeoff between speech quality and identity conversion and the challenge remains to provide optimal results for both criteria simultaneously. A new spectral conversion technique introduced in this thesis uses bilinear models to decompose the line spectral frequencies (LSF) representation of the spectral envelope into two factors corresponding to speaker identity and phonetic content respectively. In an extensive evaluation on different types and for different sizes of training data this approach was found to perform similarly to a GMM-based conversion even though, in contrast to the GMM, it does not require any tuning. The concepts of contextual and local modeling are also introduced arguing that a more accurate mapping can be achieved if multiple models are fit on relatively small subsets of the full training data rather than using one global model. The validity of the concepts has been verified in practical experiments. Furthermore, a local linear transformation technique is shown to effectively reduce the over-smoothing relatively to a globally trained GMM-based conversion function. For spectral conversion, several of the proposed techniques can be considered extensions of a baseline vector quantization framework, opening the way for further developments in this direction. In addition to the local linear transformation method which can be easily integrated in this framework, a memory efficient conversion scheme based on multi-stage vector quantization (MSVQ) was also proposed. The experiments indicated substantial memory savings and even accuracy improvement compared to some conventional codebook conversions. A dynamic programming approach to optimizing the frame to frame continuity in a vector quantization framework is also proposed as a future direction. A final contribution is brought to the existing hybrid technique that combines GMM and frequency warping. The approach is adapted to work with the proposed speech representation and a procedure for automatic formant alignment and warping function calculation is presented.",

In indoors the reverberation may cause TDOA outliers, and a set of non-linear techniques for estimating the distance is proposed. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to map the microphone pairwise distances into Cartesian microphone locations.

The aim of this experiment was to study the human ability to discriminate audio ambiances recorded in similar locations of the same urban environment. A listening experiment consisting of material from three different environments and nine different locations was carried out with nineteen subjects to study the credibility of audio representations for certain environments which would diminish the need for collecting huge audio databases. The first goal was to study to what degree humans are able to recognize whether the recording has been made in an indicated location or in another similar location, when presented with the name of the place, location on a map, and the associated audio ambiance. The second goal was to study whether the ability to discriminate audio ambiances from different locations is affected by a visual cue, by presenting additional information in form of a photograph of the suggested location. The results indicate that audio ambiances from similar urban areas of the same city differ enough so that it is not acceptable to use a single recording as ambience to represent different yet similar locations. Including an image was found to increase the perceived credibility of all the audio samples in representing a certain location. The results suggest that developers of audio-augmented location-based systems should aim at using audio samples recorded on-site for each location in order to achieve a credible impression.",

In order to overcome specific problems related to the existing features (such as lack of discriminative power), as well as to reduce the need for manual feature selection, in this article, we propose an evolutionary feature synthesis technique with a built-in feature selection scheme. The proposed synthesis process searches for optimal linear/nonlinear operators and feature weights from a pre-defined multi-dimensional search space to generate a highly discriminative set of new (artificial) features. The evolutionary search process is based on a stochastic optimization approach in which a multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization algorithm, along with fractional global best formation and heterogeneous particle behavior techniques, is applied. Unlike many existing feature generation approaches, the dimensionality of the synthesized feature vector is also searched and optimized within a set range in order to better meet the varying requirements set by many practical applications and classifiers. The new features generated by the proposed synthesis approach are compared with typical low-level audio features in several classification and retrieval tasks. The results demonstrate a clear improvement of up to 15--20% in average retrieval performance. Moreover, the proposed synthesis technique surpasses the synthesis performance of evolutionary artificial neural networks, exhibiting a considerable capability to accurately distinguish among different audio classes.

For singer identification, the thesis introduces methods from general audio classification and specific methods for dealing with the presence of accompaniment. The emphasis is on singer identification in polyphonic audio, where the singing voice is present along withmusical accompaniment. The presence of instruments is detrimental to voice identification performance, and eliminating the effect of instrumental accompaniment is an important aspect of the problem. The study of singer identification is centered around the degradation of classification performance in presence of instruments, and separation of the vocal line for improving performance. For the study, monophonic singing was mixed with instrumental accompaniment at different signalto- noise (singing-to-accompaniment) ratios and the classification process was performed on the polyphonic mixture and on the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture. The method for classification including the step for separating the vocals is improving significantly the performance compared to classification of the polyphonic mixtures, but not close to the performance in classifying the monophonic singing itself. Nevertheless, the results show that classification of singing voices can be done robustly in polyphonic music when using source separation. In the problem of lyrics transcription, the thesis introduces the general speech recognition framework and various adjustments that can be done before applying themethods on singing voice. The variability of phonation in singing poses a significant challenge to the speech recognition approach. The thesis proposes using phoneme models trained on speech data and adapted to singing voice characteristics for the recognition of phonemes and words from a singing voice signal. Language models and adaptation techniques are an important aspect of the recognition process. There are two different ways of recognizing the phonemes in the audio: one is alignment, when the true transcription is known and the phonemes have to be located, other one is recognition, when both transcription and location of phonemes have to be found. The alignment is, obviously, a simplified form of the recognition task.   

Alignment of textual lyrics to music audio is performed by aligning the phonetic transcription of the lyrics with the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture, using a collection of commercial songs. The word recognition is tested for transcription of lyrics from monophonic singing. The performance of the proposed system for automatic alignment of lyrics and audio is sufficient for facilitating applications such as automatic karaoke annotation or song browsing. The word recognition accuracy of the lyrics transcription from singing is quite low, but it is shown to be useful in a query-by-singing application, for performing a textual search based on the words recognized from the query. When some key words in the query are recognized, the song can be reliably identified.",

abstract = "Automatic guitar chord detection is a process that attempts to detect a guitar chord from a piece of audio. Generally, automatic chord detection is considered to be a part of a large problem termed as automatic transcription. Although there has been a lot of research in the field of automatic transcription, but having a reliable transcription system is still a distant prospect. Chord detection becomes interesting as chords have comparatively stable structure and they completely describe the occurring harmonies in a piece of music.

This thesis presents a novel approach for detecting the correctness of musical chords played by guitar. The approach is based on pattern matching technique applied to the database of chords and their typical mistakes. Mistakes are the versions of a chord where typical playing errors are made. Transient of a chord is skipped and its spectrum is whitened. A certain region of whitened spectra is chosen as a feature vector. Cosine distance is computed between the extracted features and the data present in a reference chord database. Finally, the system detects the correctness of a played chord based on k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier.

The developed system uses two types of spectral whitening techniques: one is based on Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and the other is based on Phase Transform-beta (PHAT-beta). The average accuracy shown by LPC based system is 72% while that of PHAT-beta is 82.5%. The system was also evaluated under different noise conditions.",

Co-occurrence of events is represented as the degree of their overlapping in a ﬁxed length segment of polyphonic audio. In the training stage, PLSA is used to learn the relationships between individual events. In detection, the PLSA model continuously adjusts the probabilities of events according to the history of events detected so far. The event probabilities provided by the model are integrated into a sound event detection system that outputs a monophonic sequence of events. The model offers a very good representation of the data, having low perplexity on test recordings. Using PLSA for estimating prior probabilities of events provides an increase of event detection accuracy to 35%, compared to 30% for using uniform priors for the events.

First, we describe how speech can be modelled as a linear combination of a small number of exemplars from a large speech exemplar dictionary. The exemplars are time-frequency patches of real speech, each spanning multiple time frames. We then propose to model speech corrupted by additive noise as a linear combination of noise and speech exemplars, and we derive an algorithm for recovering this sparse linear combination of exemplars from the observed noisy speech. We describe how the framework can be used for doing hybrid exemplar-based/HMM recognition by using the exemplar-activations together with the phonetic information associated with the exemplars.

    As an alternative to hybrid recognition, the framework also allows us to take a source separation approach which enables exemplar-based feature enhancement as well as missing data mask estimation. We evaluate the performance of these exemplar-based methods in connected digit recognition on the AURORA-2 database. Our results show that the hybrid system performed substantially better than source separation or missing data mask estimation at lower SNRs, achieving up to 57.1% accuracy at SNR= -5 dB. Although not as effective as two baseline recognisers at higher SNRs, the novel approach offers a promising direction of future research on exemplar-based ASR.",

After recovering the sparsest possible linear combination of labelled exemplars, noise robust posterior likelihoods are estimated by using the weights of the exemplars as evidence of the state labels underlying exemplars. Although promising recognition accuracies at low SNRs were obtained, the method was impractical due to its slow execution speed. Moreover, the performance was not as good on noisy speech corrupted by noise types not represented by the noise exemplars. The importance of sparsity was poorly understood, and the influence of the size of the exemplar-dictionary was unclear. In this paper we investigate all these issues, and we show for example that speedups of a factor 28 can be obtained by using modern GPUs, bringing its execution speed within range to practical applications.",

abstract = "Room surface estimation is the process of estimating and characterizing the surfaces of a room from the measurement provided by an array of microphones. In any normal room, wavefront radiated by the source reaches the microphones after reflecting from the surfaces of the room. On performing the post processing on this recorded signal, depending on the type of source signal used; we obtain the unique signature of the room called the room impulse response (RIR). Historically room impulse responses have been used to calculate the acoustical parameters. These are generally used for objective evaluation of the rooms. Here is an effort to extract more information out of the RIR by understanding the physics of it.
In this thesis the reflection from the surfaces is employed as useful information and methods to use this information are presented. The reflective information can be used in the determination of the reflection coefficient of the surface. The reflection coefficients of four common room materials are obtained from their respective impulse response at oblique incidence. The obtained reflection coefficients are studied for the classification of materials.
The problem of estimating the room surface using the reflection coefficients has been approached in a systematic way, accounting for parasitic reflections and background noise. The room impulse response is obtained using the sine sweep signal transmitted through the speaker attached to one microphone array, and recorded by another microphone array. The recorded signal was used to identify possible surfaces using clustering on the obtained reflection coefficients. The classification so obtained is compared with the ground truth to calculate the performance and practicability",

However, conventional Viterbi algorithm is forced to do a selection also when no suitable units are available. This can drift the search and decrease the overall quality. Consequently, we propose to use robust Viterbi algorithm that can simultaneously detect bad units and select the best sequence. The unsuitable units are replaced using hidden Markov model-based synthesis. Evaluations indicate that the use of robust Viterbi algorithm combined with unit replacement increases the quality compared to the traditional algorithm.",

sounds are utilized in creating a likelihood function corresponding to different bullet states. For this, a
state-space model of the underlying dynamic system is developed, and a well-known optimization algorithm
is used to find the global maximum of the evaluated function. Two different criteria are used to
measure the likelihood values, namely the Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) and the Mean-Squared Error
(MSE). The achieved localization and estimation results are accurate and applicable when considering the
usability of the method against hostile snipers. The shooter position and bullet state estimation errors
vary between 2% and 10%, depending on the estimated parameter at stake.",

author = "Jouni Paulus",
abstract = "This thesis proposes signal processing methods for the analysis of musical audio on two time scales: drum transcription on a ﬁner time scale and music structure analysis on the time scale of entire pieces. The former refers to the process of locating drum sounds in the input and recognising the instruments that were used to produce the sounds. The latter refers to the temporal segmentation of a musical piece into parts, such as chorus and verse.

For drum transcription, both low-level acoustic recognition and high-level musicological modelling methods are presented. A baseline acoustic recognition method with a large number of features using Gaussian mixture models for the recognition of drum combinations is presented. Since drums occur in structured patterns, modelling of the sequential dependencies with N-grams is proposed. In addition to the conventional N-grams, periodic N-grams are proposed to model the dependencies between events that occur one pattern length apart. The evaluations show that incorporating musicological modelling improves the performance considerably. As some drums are more probable to occur at certain points in a pattern, this dependency is utilised for producing transcriptions of signals produced with arbitrary sounds, such as beatboxing.
A supervised source separation method using non-negative matrix factorisation is proposed for transcribing mixtures of drum sounds. Despite the simple signal model, a high performance is obtained for signals without other instruments. Most of the drum transcription methods operate only on single-channel inputs, but multichannel signals are available in recording studios. A multichannel extension of the source separation method is proposed, and an increase in performance is observed in evaluations. Many of the drum transcription methods rely on detecting sound onsets for the segmentation of the signal. Detection errors will then decrease the overall performance of the system. To overcome this problem, a method utilising a network of connected hidden Markov models is proposed to perform the event segmentation and recognition jointly. The system is shown to be able to perform the transcription even from polyphonic music.
The second main topic of this thesis is music structure analysis. Two methods are proposed for this purpose. The ﬁrst relies on deﬁning a cost function for a description of the repeated parts. The second method deﬁnes a ﬁtness function for descriptions covering the entire piece. The abstract cost (and ﬁtness) functions are formulated in terms that can be determined from the input signal algorithmically, and optimisation problems are formulated. In both cases, an algorithm is proposed for solving the optimisation problems. The ﬁrst method is evaluated on a small data set, and the relevance of the cost function terms is shown. The latter method is evaluated on three large data sets with a total of 831 (557+174+100) songs. This is to date the largest evaluation of a structure analysis method. The evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms a reference system on two of the data sets.
Music structure analysis methods rarely provide musically meaningful names for the parts in the result. A method is proposed to label the parts in descriptions based on a statistical model of the sequential dependencies between musical parts. The method is shown to label the main parts relatively reliably without any additional information. The labelling model is further integrated into the ﬁtness function based structure analysis method.",

abstract = "Loudspeaker is a device that converts electric input signal to acoustic output. The most common type of loudspeaker is a moving-coil transducer. The behaviour of a moving-coil transducer can be considered to be linear only when displacement of the coil-diaphragm assembly is small. When input signal level rises, nonlinearities start to cause audible distortion. In this thesis we examine microspeaker, a small loudspeaker used in mobile phones. 

The electro-mechanical process which converts the electrical signal into sound waves is exaplained. Based on this, we present a continuous-time, linear model of a loudspeaker mounted in a closed box. The model describes the loudspeaker’s small-signal behaviour using only few parameters. We then consider the main sources of nonlinearities and how to model them. Two major sources nonlinearities are added to the continuous-time model. Then transformations from continuous-time models to discrete-time models are considered. The nonlinear model is converted to discrete-time while taking into account the properties of the microspeaker.
The main purpose of this thesis is to study performance of a algorithm that ﬁnds the parameter values of the nonlinear loudspeaker model. Performance of the algorithm is compared to performance of an earlier algorithm for the linear loudspeaker model. The parameter values are found and changes in them are tracked using an adaptive signal processing method called system identiﬁcation. The parameter values are updated using LMS algorithm. Since the discrete-time mechanical model of the microspeaker is based on a recursive ﬁlter, LMS algorithm for recursive ﬁlters is presented. We also review previous research related to parameter identiﬁcation in linear and nonlinear loudspeaker models.
Based on results from the experiments the studied algorithm is deemed to be yet incomplete. Linear parameters adapt in general quickly whereas the nonlinear parameters adapt too slowly and sometimes erroneously. The diﬀerence between the output predicted by the nonlinear loudspeaker model and the actual output of the loudspeaker (prediction error) is too high, meaning the parameters do not adapt to their true values. The model is also prone to instability. The algorithm requires further development regarding adaptation speed and prevention of instability. Other development considering initial parameter values and operation during silent moments should also be conducted in the future.",

abstract = "Personal multimedia databases contain thousands of items and other databases on the Internet may contain even billions of items. Finding a particular item manually from such databases becomes overwhelming and thus automatic search engines are required to lighten the job. Query by example refers to automatically finding multimedia items from a database, which are similar to the example provided by the user. This is an important task in modern multimedia databases. This thesis deals with automatic query by example of audio samples. The emphasis is on representation and distance measures between two audio signals, which are used to estimate the similarity between these two signals. The thesis also covers computational issues, which are highly important when it comes to practical implementation of the algorithms. Two different audio signal representations are proposed. These representations are interconnected, since the first separates drums from a polyphonic music signal although the same approach could be used to separate other parts of the original signal as well, for example, harmonic instruments. The second representation models the harmonic sound using only a few parameters. The proposed method is based on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, which are further modeled using attack-decay-sustain-release curves with temporal evolution of harmonic instruments. Most distance measures, used in audio signal processing, are based on dividing a signal into frames, extracting perceptually motivated features from each frame, and calculating the distance between the features. Most of the proposed distance measures use Gaussian mixture models to estimate the probability density functions of the framewise features and calculate the distance between the Gaussian mixture models. However, the thesis also introduces a parameter free distance measurement. This is based on compression ratios of audio signals and i hence it removes the user influence on the results, since no features or other parameters need to be set. In a query by example application, the similarity between the example provided by the user and each database item need to be calculated in order to obtain a ranked list of database samples. However, in practical applications this operation is very time-consuming if the database contains millions of items. The proposed method applies keysample transformation to reduce the series of feature vectors, used to represent each signal, into a single feature vector. The database is then clustered and the search is restricted to only a few clusters, thus saving retrieval time with some loss of accuracy.",

abstract = "Sensors are used for obtaining information from their operating environment. Recently, the use of multiple sensory units as arrays or networks has become popular. This has been caused by developments in sensor technology and the inherent application potential. Costs of sensory units and systems have decreased with developments in electronics. In addition, advances in communication technologies, such as wireless operation, make it easier to deploy systems with a large number of sensory units. Several applications exist for these systems in the areas of monitoring, control, surveillance, communications and multimedia devices. With developments, come additional requirements. Sensor systems are expected to operate for long periods of time, possibly unattended. Furthermore, environmental and signal conditions may be adverse. As a result, errors caused by disturbances occur in system output and hardware malfunctions may develop between scheduled maintenance. Automatic operation is still expected and even if human operators are available, manual inspection of the data from individual units is not feasible in large systems. This raises the need for error-tolerant processing, that is able to assess the quality of produced data and detect potential malfunctions. This thesis addresses these issues within acoustic direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. An array of microphones is utilized to acquire acoustic pressure signals from a far-field source. Time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between the sensors are estimated and used to compute the direction estimate. Specifically, the plane wave slowness vector (SV) formulation of the problem is examined, allowing a linear model to be used for estimation. In practice, signals are noisy and time delay estimates contain large errors making the directional estimates inaccurate. This work examines confidence scores that can be used to evaluate the instantaneous estimation error and to remove highly erroneous delay estimates from the processing. A robust and scalable DOA estimator is introduced. It is further demonstrated with experiments that confidence scores can be used for signal activity detection, outlier removal and sensor failure compensation. One of the examined confidence scores is based on closed-path properties of TDOAs. This score is generalized beyond the plane wave DOA domain to a difference quantity model. Examples of difference quantities include voltages and spherical-wave TDOAs used in source localization. The scoring principle is brought into a statistical framework and outlier detection is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. An optimum detector is derived and its properties are analyzed. The results of this work provide simple and computationally light means for sensor arrays to diagnose their operation instantaneously in dynamic conditions.",

However, sometimes databases contain certain inherent voice qualities that need to be parametrized properly. One example of this is vocal fry typically occurring at the end of utterances. A popular mixed excitation vocoder for HMMbased speech synthesis is STRAIGHT. The standard STRAIGHT is optimized for modal voices and may not produce high quality with other voice types. Fortunately, due to the flexibility of STRAIGHT, different F0 and aperiodicity measures can be used in the synthesis without any inherent degradations in speech quality. We have replaced the STRAIGHT excitation with a representation based on a robust F0 measure and a carefully determined two-band voicing. According to our analysis-synthesis experiments, the new parameterization can improve the speech quality. In HMM-based speech synthesis, the quality is significantly improved especially due to the better modeling of vocal fry.",

abstract = "Transcription of music refers to the analysis of a music signal in order to produce a parametric representation of the sounding notes in the signal. This is conventionally carried out by listening to a piece of music and writing down the symbols of common musical notation to represent the occurring notes in the piece. Automatic transcription of music refers to the extraction of such representations using signal-processing methods.

This thesis concerns the automatic transcription of pitched notes in musical audio and its applications. Emphasis is laid on the transcription of realistic polyphonic music, where multiple pitched and percussive instruments are sounding simultaneously. The methods included in this thesis are based on a framework which combines both low-level acoustic modeling and high-level musicological modeling. The emphasis in the acoustic modeling has been set to note events so that the methods produce discrete-pitch notes with onset times and durations as output. Such transcriptions can be efficiently represented as MIDI files, for example, and the transcriptions can be converted to common musical notation via temporal quantization of the note onsets and durations. The musicological model utilizes musical context and trained models of typical note sequences in the transcription process. Based on the framework, this thesis presents methods for generic polyphonic transcription, melody transcription, and bass line transcription. A method for chord transcription is also presented.

All the proposed methods have been extensively evaluated using realistic polyphonic music. In our evaluations with 91 half-a-minute music excerpts, the generic polyphonic transcription method correctly found 39% of all the pitched notes (recall) where 41% of the transcribed notes were correct (precision). Despite the seemingly low recognition rates in our simulations, this method was top-ranked in the polyphonic note tracking task in the international MIREX evaluation in 2007 and 2008. The methods for the melody, bass line, and chord transcription were evaluated using hours of music, where F-measure of 51% was achieved for both melodies and bass lines. The chord transcription method was evaluated using the first eight albums by The Beatles and it produced correct frame-based labeling for about 70% of the time.

The transcriptions are not only useful as human-readable musical notation but in several other application areas too, including music information retrieval and content-based audio modification. This is demonstrated by two applications included in this thesis. The first application is a query by humming system which is capable of searching melodies similar to a user query directly from commercial music recordings. In our evaluation with a database of 427 full commercial audio recordings, the method retrieved the correct recording in the topthree list for the 58% of 159 hummed queries. The method was also top-ranked in “query by singing/humming” task in MIREX 2008 for a database of 2048 MIDI melodies and 2797 queries. The second application uses automatic melody transcription for accompaniment and vocals separation. The transcription also enables tuning the user singing to the original melody in a novel karaoke application.",

abstract = "The pressure changes of an acoustic wavefront are sensed with a microphone that acts as a transducer, converting sound pressure into voltage. The voltage is then converted into digital form with an analog to digital (AD) -converter to provide a discrete time quantized digital signal. This thesis discusses methods to estimate the location of a sound source from the signals of multiple microphones.

Acoustic source localization (ASL) can be used to locate talkers, which is useful for speech communication systems such as teleconferencing and hearing aids. Active localization methods receive and send energy, whereas passive methods only receive energy. The discussed ASL methods are passive which makes them attractive for surveillance applications, such as localization of vehicles and monitoring of areas. This thesis focuses on ASL in a room environment and at moderate distances that are often present in outdoor applications. The frequency range of many commonly occurring sounds such as speech, vehicles, and jet aircraft is large. Time delay estimation (TDE) methods are suitable for estimating properties from such wideband signals. Since TDE methods have been extensively studied, the theory is attractive to apply in localization.

Time difference of arrival (TDOA) -based methods estimate the source location from measured TDOA values between microphones. These methods are computationally attractive but deteriorate rapidly when the TDOA estimates are no longer directly related to the source position. In a room environment such conditions could be faced when reverberation or noise starts to dominate TDOA estimation.

The combination of microphone pairwise TDE measurements is studied as a more robust localization solution. TDE measurements are combined into a spatial likelihood function (SLF) of source position. A sequential Bayesian method known as particle filtering (PF) is used to estimate the source position. The PF based localization accuracy increases when the variance of SLF decreases. Results from simulations and real-data show that multiplication (intersection operation) results in a SLF with smaller variance than the typically applied summation (union operation).

The above localization methods assume that the source is located in the near-field of the microphone array, i.e., the source emitted wavefront curvature is observable. In the far-field, the source wavefront is assumed planar and localization is considered by using spatially separated direction observations. The direction of arrival (DOA) of a source emitted wavefront impinging on a microphone array is traditionally estimated by steering the array to a direction that maximizes the steered response power. Such estimates can be deteriorated by noise and reverberation. Therefore, talker localization is considered using DOA discrimination.

The sound propagation delay from the source to the microphone array becomes significant at moderate distances. As a result, the directional observations from a moving sound source point behind the true source position. Omitting the propagation delay results in a biased location estimate of a moving or discontinuously emitting source. To solve this problem the propagation delay is proposed to be modeled in the estimation process. Motivated by the robustness of localization using the combination of TDE measurements, source localization by directly combining the TDE-based array steered responses is considered. This extends the near-field talker localization methods to far-field source localization. The presented propagation delay modeling is then proposed for the steered response localization. The improvement in localization accuracy by including the propagation delay is studied using a simulated moving sound source in the atmosphere.

The presented indoor localization methods have been evaluated in the Classification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) 2006 and CLEAR'07 technology evaluations. In the evaluations, the performance of the proposed ASL methods was evaluated by a third party from several hours of annotated data. The data was gathered from meetings held in multiple smart rooms. According to the obtained results from CLEAR'07 development dataset (166 min) presented in this thesis, 92 % of speech activity in a meeting situation was located within 17 cm accuracy.",

The mixture signal is decomposed into a sum of spectral bases modeled as a product of excitations and filters. The excitations are restricted to harmonic spectra and their fundamental frequencies are estimated in advance using a multipitch estimator, whereas the filters are restricted to have smooth frequency responses by modeling them as a sum of elementary functions on the Mel-frequency scale. The pitch and timbre information are used in organizing individual notes into sound sources. In the recognition, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used to represent the coarse shape of the power spectrum of sound sources and Gaussian mixture models are used to model instrument-conditional densities of the extracted features. The method is evaluated with polyphonic signals, randomly generated from 19 instrument classes. The recognition rate for signals having six note polyphony reaches 59%.",

abstract = "Signal processing methods for audio classification and music content analysis are developed in this thesis. Audio classification is here understood as the process of assigning a discrete category label to an unknown recording. Two specific problems of audio classification are considered: musical instrument recognition and context recognition. In the former, the system classifies an audio recording according to the instrument, e.g. violin, flute, piano, that produced the sound. The latter task is about classifying an environment, such a car, restaurant, or library, based on its ambient audio background.

In the field of music content analysis, methods are presented for music meter analysis and chorus detection. Meter analysis methods consider the estimation of the regular pattern of strong and weak beats in a piece of music. The goal of chorus detection is to locate the chorus segment in music which is often the catchiest and most memorable part of a song. These are among the most important and readily commercially applicable content attributes that can be automatically analyzed from music signals.

For audio classification, several features and classification methods are proposed and evaluated. In musical instrument recognition, we consider methods to improve the performance of a baseline audio classification system that uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and their first derivatives as features, and continuous-density hidden Markov models (HMMs) for modeling the feature distributions. Two improvements are proposed to increase the performance of this baseline system. First, transforming the features to a base with maximal statistical independence using independent component analysis. Secondly, discriminative training is shown to further improve the recognition accuracy of the system.

For musical meter analysis, three methods are proposed. The first performs meter analysis jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level, which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. The features obtained from an accent feature analyzer and a bank of combfilter resonators are processed by a novel probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and performs joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses.

The second method focuses on estimating the beat and the tatum. The design goal was to keep the method computationally very efficient while retaining sufficient analysis accuracy. Simplified probabilistic modeling is proposed for beat and tatum period and phase estimation, and ensuring the continuity of the estimates. A novel phase-estimator based on adaptive comb filtering is presented. The accuracy of the method is close to the first method but with a fraction of the computational cost.

The third method for music rhythm analysis focuses on improving the accuracy in music tempo estimation. The method is based on estimating the tempo of periodicity vectors using locally weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression. Regression closely relates to classification, the difference being that the goal of regression is to estimate the value of a continuous variable (the tempo), whereas in classification the value to be assigned is a discrete category label. We propose a resampling step applied to an unknown periodicity vector before finding the nearest neighbors to increase the likelihood of finding a good match from the training set. This step improves the performance of the method significantly. The tempo estimate is computed as a distance-weighted median of the nearest neighbor tempi. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significantly better tempo estimation accuracies than three reference methods.

Finally, we describe a computationally efficient method for detecting a chorus section in popular and rock music. The method utilizes a self-dissimilarity representation that is obtained by summing two separate distance matrices calculated using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient and pitch chroma features. This is followed by the detection of off-diagonal segments of small distance in the distance matrix. From the detected segments, an initial chorus section is selected using a scoring mechanism utilizing several heuristics, and subjected to further processing.",

abstract = "Voice activity detection stands for the process of recognizing speech segments from an input signal consisting of speech, pauses in the speech, silence, breathing and acoustic interference. Voice activity detection algorithm is an important part of many communication devices, such as mobile phones, because they can be used for example to reduce battery consumption and bandwidth usage. However, the communication devices and also the circumstances in which they are used vary greatly, and thus there does not exist one such voice activity detection algorithm that could be used in every case effectively but the algorithm has to be developed specifically for the problem at hand.

In the thesis a voice activity detection algorithm was developed to be used in circumstances, where a very high-level breathing sound is present in the signal. Because the property is unique when compared to previous studies, previously developed voice activity detection algorithms could not be used. Instead, a new voice activity detection algorithm that constitutes of framewise feature extraction, classification of the features and postprocessing was developed. This was done by testing many different options for the parts of the voice activity detection algorithm, evaluating systematically their contribution to the results of the detection and selecting the best combination of parts as the final voice activity detection algorithm. The final voice activity detection algorithm constitutes of Mel-frequency band energies as the features, neural network as the classifier and hidden Markov model as the postprocessing method. All the different options of the algorithm parts and the results obtained with different algorithms were presented in the thesis.",

abstract = "Text-to-phoneme (TTP) mapping, also called grapheme-to-phoneme (GTP) conversion, defines the process of transforming a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Text-to-phoneme mapping is a necessary step in any state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) system, where the textual information changes dynamically (i.e., new contact entries for name dialing, or new short messages or emails to be read out by a device). There are significant differences between the implementation requirements of a text-to-phoneme mapping module embedded into the automatic speech recognition and into the text-to-speech systems: in automatic speech recognition systems the errors of the text-to-phoneme mapping module are tolerated better (leading to occasional recognition errors) than in the text-to-speech applications, where the effect is immediately and in all cases audible.

Automatic speech recognition systems typically use text-to-phoneme mapping to lower the footprint (to avoid storing the lexicon), while maintaining quality. The use of text-to-phoneme mapping in the text-to-speech systems is different. In addition to the phonetic information, the text-to-speech systems also need prosodic information to be able to produce high quality speech, which cannot be predicted by text-to-phoneme mapping. Most state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems use explicit pronunciation lexicon, which is aimed at providing the widest possible coverage, in the order of 100K words, with high quality pronunciation information. Because of this reason, text-to-phoneme mapping is typically used as a fall-back strategy, when the system encounters very rare or non-native words and the quality of a ext-to-speech system is indirectly affected by the quality of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Another important issue is the question of training the text-to-phoneme mapping module. The problem of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is a static one and such a system is trained off-line. The correspondence between the written and spoken form of a language is usually unchanged in the lifetime of an application. So the complexity/speed of the model training is of secondary importance compared to e.g., the speed of convergence or model size.

In this thesis, the problem of text-to-phoneme mapping using neural networks is studied. One of the main goals of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of different neural network structures which can be implemented to convert a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Another important target, of this work, is to provide new solutions that improve the performance of the existing algorithms, in terms of convergence speed and phoneme accuracy. Three main neural network classes are studied in this thesis: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN).

Due to their ability of self adaptation, neural networks have been shown to be a viable solution in applications that require modeling abilities. Such an application is the text-tophoneme mapping where the correspondence between letters of a written text and their corresponding phonetic transcription must be modeled.

One of the main concerns in all practical implementations, where neural networks are used, is to develop algorithms which provide fast convergence of the synaptic weights and in the same time good mapping performances. When a neural network is trained for text-to-phoneme mapping, at every iteration, a letter-phoneme pair is presented to the network such that, the number of letters and the number of training iterations are equal. As a result, fast convergence of the neural network means smaller size of the training dictionary since fast convergence is in fact similar to less necessary training letters1. A fast convergence speed is important in applications where only a small linguistic database is available. Of course, one solution could be to use a small dictionary (with very few words) which is presented at the input of the neural network many times until the convergence of the synaptic weights is reached. In this case the time of training becomes more important. Taking into account these two sides of the convergence speed (the size of the training dictionary and the processing time during training) one can understand the importance of having algorithms that ensure fast convergence of the neural network.

It is well known that the error back-propagation algorithm which is used to train the MLP neural network, possess sometimes a quite slow convergence (a very large number of iterations required to reach the stability point). In order to increase the convergence speed two novel alternative solutions are proposed in this thesis: one using an adaptive learning rate in the training process and another which is a transform domain implementation of the multilayer perceptron neural network. The computational complexity of the two proposed training algorithms is slightly higher than the computational complexity of the error back-propagation algorithm but the number of training iterations is highly reduced. Due to this fact, although the three algorithms might have the same training time, the novel algorithms necessitate smaller training dictionary.

Due to the limitations of the processing power that usually are encountered in real devices, another very important requirement for a text-to-phoneme mapping system is to have low computational and memory costs. In the case of text-to-phoneme mapping systems based in neural networks, the computational complexity is mainly linked to the mathematical complexity of the training algorithm as well as to the number of the synaptic weights of the neural network. Memory load is due to the number of synaptic weights of the neural network which must be stored.

Taking into account all these limitations and implementation requirements, in this thesis, several neural network structures with different number of synaptic weights and trained with various training algorithms, are studied. The modeling capability of the neural networks is addressed, which is translated in the text-to-phoneme mapping case into the phoneme accuracy. Different neural network structures, training algorithms and network complexities are analyzed also from this point of view. As a remark here, we mention that input letter encoding plays a very important role in the phoneme accuracy of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system. This is why special attention has been paid to the comparative analysis of the performances (in terms of phoneme accuracy) obtained with several orthogonal and non-orthogonal encoding of the input letters.

The thesis is structured into four main parts. Chapter 1 brings the reader into the world of text-to-phoneme mapping. In Chapter 2 several different neural network structures and their corresponding training algorithms are described and two new training algorithms are introduced and analyzed. In Chapter 3 the experimental results, for the problem of monolingual text-to-phoneme mapping, obtained with the neural networks described in Chapter 2 are shown. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the problem of bilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and Chapter 5 concludes the thesis.",

abstract = "Concatenative text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is a method for artificial speech generation that utilizes a pre-recorded natural speech inventory. The intelligibility of modern TTS systems is considered relatively high thus the current emphasis is on developing the naturalness of the synthetic speech. Unit selection speech synthesis utilizes a large pre-recorded speech inventory which provides a sufficient phonetic and prosodic coverage for the language. In synthesis, the best sequence of units, typically half phones or diphones, is retrieved from the inventory and the concatenation of the units is carried out. Unlike in traditional concatenative TTS systems based on prosodic modification, no processing of unit waveforms is required. This increases the quality of the speech by avoiding the modification of units.
In this thesis, the full process of constructing a TUT_VOICE unit selection TTS synthesizer for Finnish is described. The work consisted of the construction of a Finnish voice and the implementation of a synthesis engine. The voice construction included inventory design, recording of a speech inventory with a female voice, phonetic labeling of the speech, and feature extraction. The implementation included building a target unit sequence based on the text to be synthesized, selecting the best sequence of speech units in the inventory, and creation of the output speech waveform by concatenating the selected units. Synthesis quality was in accordance with the expectations: intelligibility was good but quality varied from excellent to poor among different sentences.",

abstract = "Sound source separation refers to the task of estimating the signals produced by individual sound sources from a complex acoustic mixture. It has several applications, since monophonic signals can be processed more eﬃciently and ﬂexibly than polyphonic mixtures.

This thesis deals with the separation of monaural, or, one-channel music recordings. We concentrate on separation methods, where the sources to be separated are not known beforehand. Instead, the separation is enabled by utilizing the common properties of real-world sound sources, which are their continuity, sparseness, and repetition in time and frequency, and their harmonic spectral structures. One of the separation approaches taken here use unsupervised learning and the other uses model-based inference based on sinusoidal modeling.

Most of the existing unsupervised separation algorithms are based on a linear instantaneous signal model, where each frame of the input mixture signal is modeled as a weighted sum of basis functions. We review the existing algorithms which use independent component analysis, sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization to estimate the basis functions from an input mixture signal.

Our proposed unsupervised separation algorithm based on the instantaneous model combines non-negative matrix factorization with sparseness and temporal continuity objectives. The algorithm is based on minimizing the reconstruction error between the magnitude spectrogram of the observed signal and the model, while restricting the basis functions and their gains to non-negative values, and the gains to be sparse and continuous in time. In the minimization, we consider iterative algorithms which are initialized with random values and updated so that the value of the total objective cost function decreases at each iteration. Both multiplicative update rules and a steepest descent algorithm are proposed for this task. To improve the convergence of the projected steepest descent algorithm, we propose an augmented divergence to measure the reconstruction error. Simulation experiments on generated mixtures of pitched instruments and drums were run to monitor the behavior of the proposed method. The proposed method enables average signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) of 7.3 dB, which is higher than the SDRs obtained with the other tested methods based on the instantaneous signal model.

To enable separating entities which correspond better to real-world sound objects, we propose two convolutive signal models which can be used to represent time-varying spectra and fundamental frequencies. We propose unsupervised learning algorithms extended from non-negative matrix factorization for estimating the model parameters from a mixture signal. The objective in them is to minimize the reconstruction error between the magnitude spectrogram of the observed signal and the model while restricting the parameters to non-negative values. Simulation experiments show that time-varying spectra enable better separation quality of drum sounds, and time-varying frequencies representing diﬀerent fundamental frequency values of pitched instruments conveniently. Another class of studied separation algorithms is based on the sinusoidal model, where the periodic components of a signal are represented as the sum of sinusoids with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. The model provides a good representation for pitched instrument sounds, and the robustness of the parameter estimation is here increased by restricting the sinusoids of each source to harmonic frequency relationships.
Our proposed separation algorithm based on sinusoidal modeling minimizes the reconstruction error between the observed signal and the model. Since the rough shape of spectrum of natural sounds is continuous as a function of frequency, the amplitudes of overlapping overtones can be approximated by interpolating from adjacent overtones, for which we propose several methods. Simulation experiments on generated mixtures of pitched musical instruments show that the proposed methods allow average SDR above 15 dB for two simultaneous sources, and the quality decreases gradually as the number of sources
increases.",

The author describes the principles of adaptive filtering, presents the best known adaptive filtering algorithms and introduces some more sophisticated algorithms based on these. The aim is to develop non-linear models for modelling echo path alongside traditional linear models. These non-linear models try to model the non-linear distortion, which is inflicted into the sound by the small and inexpensive audio equipment. The aim is also to consider side-effects of these non-linear models and how these side-effeets eould be avoided.Since these non-linear models are quite sensitive to the input signals, the mechanisms for controlling adaptive filtering algorithms are studied.",

Specifically, we study the influence of the input letter encoding in the conversion accuracy of such system. We show, that for large network complexities the orthogonal binary codes (as introduced in NetTalk) gives better performance. On the other hand in applications that require very small memory load and computational complexity other compact codes may be more suitable.

abstract = "This thesis concerns the problem of automatic transcription of music and proposes a method for transcribing monophonic melodies. Recently, computational music content analysis has received considerable attention among researchers due to the rapid growth of music databases. In this area of research, melody transcription plays an important role. Automatic melody transcription can beneﬁt professional musicians and provide interesting applications for consumers, including music retrieval and interactive music applications.

The proposed method is based on two probabilistic models: a note event model and a musicological model. The note event model is used to represent note candidates in melodies, and it is based on hidden Markov models. The note event model is trained with an acoustic database of singing sequences, but the training can be done for any melodic instrument and for the desired front-end feature extractors. The musicological model is used to control the transitions between the note candidates by using musical key estimation and by computing the likelihoods of note sequences. The two models are combined to constitute a melody transcription system with a modular architecture.

The transcription system is evaluated, and the results are good. Our system transcribes correctly over 90 % of notes, thus halving the amount of errors compared to a simple rounding of pitch estimates to the nearest MIDI note numbers. Particularly, using the note event model signiﬁcantly improves the system performance.",

abstract = "Collections of digital music have become increasingly common over the recent years. As the amount of data increases, digital content management is becoming more important. In this thesis, we are studying content-based classification of acoustic musical signals according to their musical genre (e.g., classical, rock) and the instruments used. A listening experiment is conducted to study human abilities to recognise musical genres. This thesis covers a literature review on human musical genre recognition, state-of-the-art musical genre recognition systems, and related fields of research. In addition, a general-purpose music database consisting of recordings and their manual annotations is introduced. The theory behind the used features and classifiers is reviewed and the results from the simulations are presented.

The developed musical genre recognition system uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to represent the time-varying magnitude spectrum of a music signal. The class-conditional feature densities are modelled with hidden Markov models. Musical instrument detection for a few pitched instruments from music signals is also studied using the same structure. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a method for the detection of drum instruments. The presence of drums is determined based on the periodicity of the amplitude envelopes of the signal at subbands.
The conducted listening experiment shows that the recognition of musical genres is not a trivial task even for humans. On the average, humans are able to recognise the correct genre in 75 % of cases (given five-second samples). Results also indicate that humans can do rather accurate musical genre recognition without long-term temporal features, such as rhythm. For the developed automatic recognition system, the obtained recognition accuracy for six musical genres was around 60 %, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems. Detection accuracy of 81 % was obtained with the proposed drum instrument detection method.",

The system consisted of a signal processing front-end which calculated a continuous pitch track and of a probabilistic model which converted the pitch track into a discrete musical notation.

The proposed probabilistic model consisted of three parts operating in parallel: a pitch trajectory model, a musicological model, and a duration model. The first handled imperfections in the performed/estimated pitch values using a hidden Markov model, the second estimated the musical key signature to improve the transcription accuracy ant the last models the duration of the notes. The thesis covered a literature review on human voice production and on the theory of pitch estimation. In addition, an inspection of an acoustic database recorded for the training and the testing of the proposed model was introduced. The most important part of the thesis is the chapter with the three probabilistic models.",

abstract = "This thesis proposes algorithms to be utilized for iterative design of linear filters and for adaptive polynomial filtering. The goal is to improve existing algorithms in terms of filtering performance, time and complexity requirements.

First, a family of fast algorithms suitable for adaptive polynomial filtering, namely LS-LMS algorithm and its square root variants, is introduced and its connection with the family of RLS algorithms is analyzed. The algorithms are derived by combining the triangularization and backsolving steps of QR-RLS algorithm. In the derivation we allow a modification of the cost function in order to decrease the complexity of the algorithm from O(M^2) to O(M), where M is the number of filter parameters.

Second, adaptive filtering algorithms are proposed for the problem of acoustic echo control in the case of strong acoustic distortion in the loudspeaker that decreases the echo attenuation obtained using adaptive linear filtering algorithms in echo cancelers. Several existing algorithms were tested using both linear and homogeneous Volterra filters, but their performance was not found satisfactory either in terms of performance or complexity. A polynomial preprocessor followed by a linear filter was found to perform well when the preprocessor was adapted by the robust, but computationally demanding, QR-RLS algorithm and the linear part was adapted by the normalized LMS algorithm.

Third, the problem of optimum energy compaction for FIR and IIR filters is addressed. The analytical method for optimum compaction FIR filter design is analyzed and shown to provide a very fast algorithm under certain conditions. For the design of optimum compaction IIR filters two new methods are proposed. 

The first design method operates with the numerator and the denominator in the causal part of the associated product filter, which are in turn optimized via iterative relaxations. The second method is similar, except that the angles of the poles are set to fixed values, situated at the transitions in the frequency representation of the corresponding ideal brickwall filter. Thus, the second method is faster than the first, and, moreover, it was observed that when the ideal brickwall filter does not have too many transitions, the second method provides filters with better performance. Both methods make use of semidefinite programming optimization using an appropriate parameterization of positive real polynomials.

The last part of the thesis provides contributions to the frequency selective IIR filter design. The frequency response of the filter is fitted to an ideal frequency response by optimizing either a weighted sum of magnitude squares (least squares) criterion or a minimax (Chebyshev) criterion. For the least squares criterion a new convex stability domain is used and experimental evidence is given that the best designs are usually obtained with a multistage algorithm where three methods, Steiglitz-McBride, Gauss-Newton and classical descent, are used consecutively in that order. The result of multistage least squares IIR design is used to initialize the optimization procedure based on a Chebyshev criterion, for which a simplified iterative procedure is proposed. In the simplified procedure only the numerator is updated after initialization. The simplified procedure is compared experimentally with the complete procedure and the results show only very small differences in the criterion.",

abstract = "New methods for the design, analysis and generalization of polynomial predictive filters (polynomial predictors for short) are developed in this thesis. Polynomial predictors are a subclass of linear mathematical filters, i.e. linear transformations that transform an input sequence of numbers to an output sequence. Filters are in general used to modify or extract useful information from a signal. Examples of filters are echo cancellers in telephone networks, vocal tract filters in speech synthesizers and analysis filters for EEG signals. Polynomial predictors are useful in situations where the signal of interest changes relatively slowly. Examples of slowly varying signals that can be successfully modeled by polynomials include displacement curves of elevators, the received power level in mobile communication systems and angular accelaration in motor drives.

Generally, the filtering of a signal causes delay. However, in many applications, particularly control systems, it is desirable to minimize the delay caused by filtering. Furthermore, the signals in any real-world application contain noise, which we also wish to minimize by filtering. For example, calculating the moving average of a signal generally reduces the noise in the signal, but also causes delay. Polynomial predictors are filters that can predict polynomial signals, and in addition reduce the noise in the signal.

In this thesis we determine the precise class of IIR filters which are polynomial predictors, which unifies the various previously proposed predictor structures. Design methods are developed for optimal least-squares FIR polynomial predictors, which enable arbitrary prediction steps, error weighting and an arbitrary desired frequency response. The parameters of predictors based on the general IIR structure are optimized, yielding improvements over the best previously known IIR polynomial predictors. An analysis of the asymptotic properties of polynomial predictors as the filter length grows without bound is carried out, yielding insight into the characteristics of predictors in general, as well as proving a conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of the noise gain.

Predictors are generalized for more general signal models than polynomials, and the resulting signal model (corresponding to the solutions of linear homogenous finite difference equations) is shown to be the most general possible. The generalization of the signal model can be interpreted in terms of a z-plane diagram which specifies the complex exponential signals that are predicted. The design methods for FIR polynomial predictors are also carried over to this general signal model. The generalized signal model includes e.g. sinusoidal signals and the design methods are applied to finding improved filters for use in a 50Hz line frequency signal processing application.

In addition to the signal model, the filter type is also generalized. This yields design methods for finding the optimal parameters of differentiators, predictive differentiators and integrators, among others. The asymptotic noise gain of generalized predictors is derived and found to depend on the largest modulus of the complex numbers which specify the signal model. Furthermore, an efficient implementation for generalized FIR predictors is derived.",

VAD is assumed to give additional information to the ASR system about the presence of speech, thus increasing the robustness of the ASR system. Two standard VAD algorithms (G.729b and GSM) are described and a statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based VAD is introduced.

For the GMM based VAD, different adaptation techniques are employed to track the changing background noise statistics. The VAD algorithms are integrated with the ASR system, with explicit and implicit approaches. The explicit approach means that the VAD is a separate module in the front end of the ASR system, while in the implicit approach the VAD decision is included in the decoding stage of the speech recognition unit. The performance of the VAD algorithms are compared directly using frame classification rates and indirectly using recognition rates. Recognition is performed as a small vocabulary isolated word recognition task with a Hidden Model based ASR system using normalized Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. According to our simulations, ideal information about the word boundaries increases significantly the recognition accuracy of the ASR system. However, the described VAD algorithms were not able to increase the recognition accuracy significantly.",

abstract = "This thesis concerns the problem of automatic recognition of a person based on his or her voice. The main objective is on the text-independent speaker identification task. A few different feature extraction algorithms are presented and evaluated using the KING and POLYCOST speech corpora. The principal feature used are the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, but also other feature sets are considered including the spectral slope and the fundamental frequency.The work concentrates mostly on different classification algorithms used in speaker recognition.

The biggest attention is on the Gaussian mixture speaker models (GMM) which have been widely used in many text-independent speaker recognition studies. Conventionally, the GMM parameters are trained with the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. An identification accuracy of 95.8% is achieved using this method for a population of 25 speakers with 60 seconds of training speech and a test sequence of 5 seconds.A drawback of the conventional EM training is the need for selecting the number of the mixture components, i.e. the model order, before the actual training procedure. Moreover, the number of components is usually the same for each speaker. The most important part of this thesis concerns simultaneous order selection and parameter training of GMMs. We evaluate a couple of recently proposed algorithms capable of selecting the order of each speaker model individually during a single training procedure. The algorithms provide a straightforward way of adjusting the number of components of each GMM to the acoustic characteristics and amount of available training data for each speaker. The methods are based on integrating some model complexity criterion, such as the minimum descripition length, into the EM training process. It is observed that when the amount of available training data varies between speakers, a relative reduction of 13% in error rate is obtained using an algorithm proposed by Figueiredo and Jain [Figueiredo02]. If the speech samples are recorded over a telephone line, a reduction of 11% in error rate is observed using the agglomerative EM algorithm [Figueiredo99].",

abstract = "This thesis concerns the development and evaluation of signal processing methods that compensate for the hearing disorders caused by ageing. The global ageing increases the number of elderly people with hearing impairment. In most cases this impairment is irrecoverable and cannot be medically or surgically treated. The only option is to process the sound going to the ear, so that it would be as clear and intelligible as possible. The multichannel dynamic compression is such a processing. With the multichannel compression the need for amplified sound and the problems of redused dynamic range can be solved. The compression reduces the loudness fluctuations in the sound so that when sound is amplified, loud sounds do not sound too loud. As a degree of the hearing impairment is more severe in high frequency bands and by processing the bands individually.

In this work, I have implemented a three- channel dynamic compression system controllable in real-time. The system was used to conduct listening tests for hearing impaired: The goal was to found a relationship between the audiogram (which represents the hearing threshold level and uncomfortable listening level measured by using sinusoids as stimuli) and the parameters of the multichannel dynamic compression system. In the first listening test, only a week relationship between the two was found. A second test was conducted in order to find out if the adjusted parameter were actually the most intelligible. This was realised using a paired comparison test. In this tests, four different processing were compared. The results shows that the spectral shaping was judged to be the processing which made speech the most intelligible. The compression was disliked and the possible reason for this is that the stimuli were very intelligible and power-normalised already before processing. There was no room for further improvement in intelligibility and thus the distortions caused by compression were perceived unpleasant",

abstract = "This thesis concerns the automatic recognition of musical instruments, where the idea is to build computer systems that “listen” to musical sounds and recognize which instrument is playing. Experimental material consisted of 5286 single notes from Western orchestral instruments, the timbre of which have been studied in great depth. The literature review part of this thesis introduces the studies on the sound of musical instruments, as well as related knowledge on instrument acoustics. Together with the state-of-the-art in automatic sound source recognition systems, these form the foundation for the most important part of this thesis: the extraction of perceptually relevant features from acoustic musical signals.

Several different feature extraction algorithms were implemented and developed, and used as a front-end for a pattern recognition system. The performance of the system was evaluated in several experiments. Using feature vectors that included cepstral coefﬁcients and features relating to the type of excitation, brightness, modulations, asynchronity and fundamental frequency of tones, an accuracy of 35 % was obtained on a database including several examples of 29 instruments. The recognition of the family of the instrument between six possible classes was successful in 77 % of the cases.

The performance of the system and the confusions it made were compared to the results reported for human perception. The comparison shows that the performance of the system is worse than that of humans in a similar task (46 % in individual instrument and 92 % in instrument family recognition [Martin99]), although it is comparable to the performance of other reported systems. Confusions of the system resemble those of human subjects, indicating that the feature extraction algorithms have managed to capture perceptually relevant information from the acoustic signals.",

abstract = "An acoustic environment surrounding a listener, an auditory scene, can provide contextual cues that enable the recognition of the scene. This thesis concerns the problem of computational auditory scene recognition, which is a subproblem of computational auditory scene analysis. Computational auditory scene analysis refers to the computational analysis of an acoustic environment, and the recognition of distinct sound events in it. In this study, the focus is not in analyzing and recognizing discrete sound events (although they may be used in the recognition process), but in the classiﬁcation of acoustic environments as whole.


This thesis covers all the different phases of a study that was made at the Signal Processing Laboratory of Tampere University of Technology: a literature review on auditory scene recognition and related ﬁelds of research, acoustic measurements that were made in a number of everyday auditory environments, design and implementation of the audio database access software, a listening test examining human abilities in auditory scene recognition, audio signal classiﬁcation theory, algorithm development and simulations.

The core of this thesis is in the computational audio classiﬁcation and signal processing algorithm development part. Auditory scene recognition involves correct grouping of similar environments, feature selection and extraction, and the use of a suitable classiﬁcation algorithm. A crucial step in solving the problem is to determine appropriate features that can discriminatebetween the acoustic data associated with pre-deﬁned scene classes.

The conducted listening tests show that, on average, humans are able to recognize 25 different scenes with 70 % accuracy. The scenes included everyday outside and inside environments,such as streets, market places, restaurants, and family homes. The performance of the computational classiﬁcation methods was investigated by conducting Matlab simulations. The bestobtained recognition rate for 13 different scenes was 56%, where the classiﬁed scenes wereselected so that from each one there were at least three recordings from different locations. We also did an experiment of recognizing more general classes (meta-classes), and for certain categorizations of the scenes we obtained relatively good classiﬁcation results. For example, themeta-class car vs. other was classiﬁed correctly in 95% of the cases.",

abstract = "In audio signal spectrum modeling, the aim is to transform a signal to a more easily applicable form, removing the information that is irrelevant in signal perception. Sinusoids plus noise model is a spectral model, in which the periodic components of the sound are represented with sinusoids with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes and phases. The remaining non-periodic components are represented with a ﬁltered noise. The sinusoidal model utilizes the physical properties of musical instruments and the noise model the humans’ inability to perceive the exact spectral shape or phase of stochastic signals.

In the case of polyphonic music signals, the estimation of the parameters of sinusoids is a difficult task, since the periodic components are usually not stable. A sufficient time and frequency resolution is also difficult to achieve at the same time. A big part of this thesis discusses the detection and parameter estimation of periodic components with several algorithms. In addition to already existing algorithms, a new iterative algorithm is presented, which is based on the fusion of closely spaced sinusoids.
The sinusoidal model is applied in the separation of overlapping sounds and manipulation. In the sound separation, a new perceptual distance measure between sinusoids is used. The perceptual distance measure is based on the humans’ way to associate spectral components into sound sources. Also a new separation method based on the multipitch estimation is explained. The modification of the pitch and time scale of sounds with the sinusoid plus noise model without affecting the quality of the sound is explained shortly, too.",

abstract = "We introduce an adaptive algorithm for constraining the amplitude of speech signals while at the same time trying to maintain the subjective loudness and trying not to produce disturbing artifacts. The algorithm can be applied to compensate for the clipping distortion of amplifiers in speech reproduction devices. The algorithm analyzes the speech signal on multiple frequency bands and applies an internal audibility law in order to make inaudible changes to the signal. An example of the audibility law, presented in the form of a matrix, is described, associated with a specific speech reproduction device. Multiple band-pass signals are processed with a waveshaper to accomplish soft-clipping and to constrain the amplitude of the processed signal. When processed with the proposed algorithm, the computational loudness value of speech signals was found to diminish only slightly (approximately 6 sones) during processing, while at the same time the signal amplitude could be reduced by even 15 dB.",

abstract = "The interest in modulation classification has recently emerged in the research of communication systems. This has been due to the advances in reconfigurable signal processing systems, especially in the study of software radio. Published methods can be divided into two groups: maximum likelihood and pattern recognition approaches. In the maximum likelihood approach, decision rules are often simple but the test statistics are complicated and assume prior knowledge about the signals. In the pattern recognition approach, decision rules are often complicated whereas the features are simple and fast to calculate.

Communication signals contain a vast amount of uncertainty due to the unknown modulating signal, modulation type, and noise. Therefore the modulation classification problem has to be approached by using statistical methods. The features and the test statistics may be derived from the known statistical characteristics of the modulated signals. Either implicit or explicit use of higher-order statistics has been studied previously in many communication applications. The higher-order statistics are often more preferable because second-order statistics suppress the phase information of the signal. Nevertheless, the estimation of the higher-order statistics requires long sample sets and has a high computational complexity. To overcome these problems, second-order cyclostationary statistics have been studied and the results seem promising.

In this thesis, the feature extraction problem of the modulation classification is discussed. Useful characteristics and representations of the communication signals are presented as well as the relevant knowledge of statistical signal processing. The previous methods are presented in a literature review of the modulation classification. The first and second-order statistics including the cyclostationary statistics of digital modulated signals are studied, and a novel feature is proposed. Some previous methods and this novel feature are compared by investigating their discrimination performance in Matlab simulations.",

abstract = "This thesis concerns the transcription of music, where the idea is to pick a musical performance by a microphone or from a musical recording, and convert it into a symbolic representation. According to musical practice, this requires extraction of notes, their pitches, timings, and classiﬁcation of the instruments used. The respective subproblems, pitch tracking, rhythm detection and the analysis of musical instruments, were studied and are reviewed. Emphasis of this thesis is laid on two points: on literature review and on algorithm development. A literature review was conducted on automatic music transcription and several related areas of interest. An appropriate decomposition of the problem and the selection of an approach is ﬁrst considered. Then the state-of-the-art of the research is represented and discussed, and promising directions for further work are indicated.

An original and the most important part of this thesis concerns the development of algorithms that can be used to detect and observe harmonic sounds in polyphonic signals. A novel number theoretical method is proposed, which is motivated by the spectral properties of a mixture of harmonic sounds, especially in musical signals. The performance of the method is evaluated by applying it in a piano music transcription program, which was implemented and simulated in Matlab environment.
In the last chapter, the role and use of internal models and predictions in music transcription are discussed. This part of the work introduces processing principles that utilize high-level knowledge sources, such as instrument models and perception-based dependencies in music.",

The differences in the arrival times of the wideband signal received by spatially separated sensors are estimated using the polarity coincidence correlation. These time differences, i.e. time delays, determine the angle of arrival. In this paper the effects of quantization of the time delays are studied. It is found out that this simple method gives comparable performance to the conventional direct correlation based methods in the case of a relatively high signal to noise ratio.",

We build the combined detector as a Boolean function of thresholded detector scores and implement it as a binary classification cascade. The cascade structure is computationally efficient by providing the possibility to early termination. For the proposed Boolean combination function, the computational load of classification is reduced whenever the function becomes determinate before all the component detectors have been utilized. We also propose an algorithm, which selects all the needed thresholds for the component detectors within the proposed Boolean combination. We present results on two audio-visual datasets, which prove the efficiency of the proposed combination framework. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially reduced computation time in laughter detection task, and our algorithm finds better thresholds for the component detectors within the Boolean combination than the other algorithms found in the literature.",

The 3D CNN enables the network to simultaneously learn the inter-and intra-channel features from the input multichannel audio. In order to evaluate the proposed method, multichannel audio datasets with different number of overlapping sound sources are synthesized. Each of this dataset has a four-channel first-order Ambisonic, binaural, and single-channel versions, on which the performance of SED using the proposed method are compared to study the potential of SED using multichannel audio. A similar study is also done with the binaural and single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development dataset. The proposed method learns to recognize overlapping sound events from multichannel features faster and performs better SED with a fewer number of training epochs. The results show that on using multichannel Ambisonic audio in place of single-channel audio we improve the overall F-score by 7.5%",

Artificial neural networks are inspired by the operation of biological neural networks, where individual neurons receive inputs from other connected neurons.

It reviews the enhancement framework of microphone array signals using beamforming with post-filtering. The chapter presents an overview of the supervised learning framework used for the TF mask-based speech enhancement. It explores the effectiveness of feed-forward neural networks for a real-world enhancement application using recordings from everyday noisy environments, where a microphone array is used to capture the signals. Estimated instrumental intelligibility and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scores are evaluated to measure how well the predicted masks improve speech quality, using networks trained on different input features.}

The most common signal enhancement techniques for microphone arrays are based on the design of directional filters or beamforming. This chapter provides a brief overview of these techniques, with a focus on post-filtering techniques. In adaptive beamformers there is a trade-off between directional selectivity and noise amplification which can be observed in the directivity factor. A class of adaptive beamformers are described as part of the informed spatial filters that combine beamforming with noise reduction. Time-frequency masking is commonly applied at the output of the beamformer to adjust the spectrum to better match that of the desired source signal. The post-filters are only capable of reducing uncorrelated or correlated noise in the beamforming output, and rely on the output of the beamformer for the suppression of the interference.}
