While recent research has made major strides in developing more powerful learning models and evaluation protocols grounded in infant data, models are still predominantly trained with non-naturalistic input data, such as crowd-sourced read speech or text transcripts. This is due to the lack of suitable child-directed speech (CDS) corpora in terms of scale and quality. In parallel, the question of how properties and individual variability in language input affect learning outcomes is an active area of empirical research, underlining the need for realistic yet controllable data for modeling such phenomena. This paper presents a solution to the training data problem through stochastic generation of naturalistic CDS data using statistical models, thereby enabling controlled computational simulations with naturalistic input. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the approach by showing how naturalistic CDS transcripts can be generated with a language model conditioned on recipient information (here, infant age), and how text-to-speech systems can be used to convert the transcripts to high-quality speech with a controllable speaking style. We also conduct modeling experiments with generated speech corpora by varying different aspects of the data, showing how this maps into different learning outcomes, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for controlled language learning simulations.

The dataset contains 2061 video clips constituting a total of 28.8 hours. We provide up to 5 captions for the audio, visual, and audio-visual content of each clip, crowdsourced separately. Existing datasets focus on a single modality or do not provide modality-specific captions, limiting the study of how each modality contributes to overall comprehension in multimodal settings. Our dataset addresses this critical gap in multimodal research by offering a resource for studying how audio and visual content are captioned individually, as well as how audio-visual content is captioned in relation to these individual modalities. Crowdsourced audio-visual captions are prone to favor visual content over audio content. To avoid this we use large language models (LLMs) to generate three balanced audio-visual captions for each clip based on the crowdsourced captions. We present captioning and retrieval experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of modality-specific captions in evaluating model performance. Specifically, we show that the modality-specific captions allow us to quantitatively assess how well a model understands audio and visual information from a given video. Notably, we find that a model trained on the balanced LLM-generated audio-visual captions captures audio information more effectively compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions. This model achieves a 14\% higher Sentence-BERT similarity on crowdsourced audio captions compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions, which are typically more biased towards visual information.

Even expert-based annotations can suffer from label inconsistencies, especially in the case of ambiguous phenomena-to-annotate. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, iterative annotation refinement (IAR) 2.0, for refining inconsistent annotations for time-series data. IAR 2.0 uses a procedure that utilizes discriminative classifiers to iteratively combine original annotations with increasingly accurate posterior estimates of classes present in the data. Unlike most existing label refinement approaches, IAR 2.0 offers a simpler yet effective solution for resolving ambiguities in training labels, working with real label noise on time-series data instead of synthetic label noise on image data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through five distinct classification tasks on two highly distinct data modalities. As a result, we show that the labels produced by IAR 2.0 systematically improve classifier performance compared to using the original labels or a previous state-of-the-art method for label refinement. We also conduct a set of controlled simulations to systematically investigate when IAR 2.0 fails to improve on the original training labels. The simulation results demonstrate that IAR 2.0 improves performance in nearly all tested conditions. We also find that the decrease in performance when IAR 2.0 fails is small compared to the average performance gain when IAR 2.0 succeeds, encouraging the use of IAR 2.0 even when the nature of data is unknown.

The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data.

Current audio-caption datasets (e.g., Clotho) contain audio samples paired with annotated captions, but lack relevance information about audio samples and captions beyond the annotated ones. Besides, mainstream approaches (e.g., CLAP) usually treat the annotated pairs as positives and consider all other audio-caption combinations as negatives, assuming a binary relevance between audio samples and captions. To infer the relevance between audio samples and arbitrary captions, we propose a method that computes non-binary audio-caption relevance scores based on the textual similarities of audio captions. We measure textual similarities of audio captions by calculating the cosine similarity of their Sentence-BERT embeddings and then transform these similarities into audio-caption relevance scores using a logistic function, thereby linking audio samples through their annotated captions to all other captions in the dataset. To integrate the computed relevances into training, we employ a listwise ranking objective, where relevance scores are converted into probabilities of ranking audio samples for a given textual query.

The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection of different postures and movements, which may support more detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative recording configurations and the attainable analyses of naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal resolution derivative statistics when the data represents naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving infants (N=41; age range 4‐18 months) recorded with a multisensor wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a modest reduction in movement classification performance (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58). Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53).

The information is ultimately perceived by the listener as subjective interpretations. While affect is part of everyday conversational communication, there is little existing research on expression and perception of affect in spoken Finnish [8][7], not to mention across different idiolectal subgroups such as speakers of different age or dialectal background. Since expression and interpretation of affect in language is known to depend on cultural and social conventions, better understanding of the expression of affect in Finnish would be desirable. The goal of our work is to research how affect is expressed in everyday spoken Finnish using large-scale data. A prerequisite for our research on affective language is a speech corpus containing unscripted audio recordings of speech paired with metadata (or annotations) containing information about the affective expression. However, we are aware of only two Finnish speech corpora related to affect, both consisting of acted emotional expressions while reading a pre-defined script and consisting only a small amount of speech in total [1][5]. In contrast, several large-scale datasets containing unscripted speech in Finnish exists [4][2][6], but they lack affect related metadata. Building an affective speech corpus can be done in several ways, typically by recording acted speech in a controlled setting or utilizing publicly available free speech audio sources from different medias such as podcasts, radio or television. The trade-off when building these types of datasets is typically between the richness and balance of affective expression present in the data and the level of information the dataset contains about the expression in the data [3]. In this presentation, we will describe our approach to compiling a spoken Finnish dataset for the study of affective expression by combining the LahjoitaPuhetta, HelPuhe and TamPuhe datasets. The dataset will be built by aligning the audio recordings with their respective text transcriptions and split into individual utterance samples (consisting of audio and text). Each utterance sample in the dataset will be augmented with a text sentiment, speech-to-noise ratio and audio based emotion estimates first by using automated tools and finally annotating a subset of samples manually. The final dataset can be used to build better tools for automated affect related annotation providing more options for researching affect and idiolectical variation using large-scale data.

The proposed method trains a model to generate invariant latent representations of speech-containing audio recordings that cannot be distinguished from non-speech recordings by a speech classifier. The novelty of our work is in the optimization algorithm, where the speech classifier's weights are regularly replaced with the weights of classifiers trained in a supervised manner. This increases the discrimination power of the speech classifier constantly during the adversarial training, motivating the model to generate latent representations in which speech is not distinguishable, even using new speech classifiers trained outside the adversarial training loop.

Crucially, annotation across available training datasets can be inconsistent and hence sound events of one dataset may be present but not annotated in an other one. As such, systems have to cope with potentially missing target labels during training. Moreover, as an additional novelty, systems are also evaluated on labels with different granularity in order to assess their robustness for different applications. To lower the entry barrier for participants, we developed an updated baseline system with several caveats to address these aforementioned problems.

Typical empirical research on child language development (CLD) consists of well-controlled focused studies conducted in laboratory conditions. In contrast, only a few high-level theories, like NLM-e (Kuhl et al., 2008) and PRIMIR (Werker \& Curtin, 2005), have aimed to integrate the present understanding of CLD into unified frameworks. However, these frameworks have not gained unanimous acceptance in the field, largely since they are relatively abstract, and only qualitatively describe the mechanisms and representations that could be involved in CLD. As a result, we still have limited understanding of the basic mechanisms and their interactions driving early language acquisition. In principle, computational modelling of CLD is a potential solution to the so-called “integration problem” across empirical findings. This is because computational models can, and must, explicitly address all aspects of the information processing chain from input data to the resulting behavior. By formulating the theories as high-level computational goals and operations, implementing them as functional signal processing and machine learning algorithms, and finally exposing the models to realistic input data comparable to what real infants experience, ecological plausibility and validity of the underlying theories can be explicitly tested. However, the scientific impact of the existing modeling efforts has also been limited. Instead of addressing multiple aspects of language in one model, earlier models have usually focused on individual language phenomena (e.g., phonemic learning or word segmentation). Moreover, they have rarely investigated learning as a function of the developmental timeline of the learner. We argue that two main factors currently hinder the development of more comprehensive, ecologically valid, and thus influential models of CLD: 1) lack of ecologically valid and openly available large-scale speech data to simulate child language experiences at a realistic scale, where various adult speech corpora are currently used instead, and 2) limited validation of the models with respect to empirical data on real infant language learning, where the current standard approach is to evaluate the models against linguistic theory of how speech is formally structured. Without fixing the data and evaluation problems, it is difficult to develop models that could truly help us to understand the big picture of CLD. In this talk, we provide an overview of our ongoing “Modeling Child Language Development using Naturalistic Data at a Scale” (L-SCALE) project, where the aim is to enable development of more comprehensive and ecologically valid computational models of CLD. To achieve this, the L-SCALE project tackles the two challenges identified above: 1) solving the ecologically valid training data problem by creating a pipeline called Generator of Infant Language ExperienceS (GILES) for generation of ecologically relevant large-scale training data for computational models, and 2) solving the mismatch between human data and computational model evaluation by developing evaluation protocols that enable comparison of computational models against empirical data on CLD as a function of learner{\textquoteright}s age. We will also showcase some recent developments of the project, including a proof- of-concept demonstration of the GILES pipeline and a meta-analytic approach to compare models to empirical data on infant language learning.

In this paper, we present a new recurrent architecture that uses unordered sets to represent both its input and its state and that is invariant to the permutations of the input set and equivariant to the permutations of the state set. Hence, the information of every sound source is represented in an individual embedding and the new estimates are assigned to the tracked trajectories regardless of their order.",  author    = "\{Diaz-Guerra Aparicio\}, David and Archontis Politis and Antonio Miguel and Beltran, \{Jose Ramon\} and Tuomas Virtanen",  year      = "2024",  doi       = "10.48550/arXiv.2306.08510",  language  = "English",  publisher = "European Acoustics Association",  pages     = "2137",  booktitle = "Proceedings of the 10th Convention of the European Acoustics Association Forum Acusticum 2023",  note      = "Convention of the European Acoustics Association Forum Acusticum ; Conference date: 11-09-2023 Through 15-09-2023"}

The key step in AVC is to randomly sample audio and video clips from the dataset and learn to minimize the feature distance between the positive pairs (corresponding audio-video pair) while maximizing the distance between the negative pairs (non-corresponding audio-video pairs). The learnt features are shown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, these methods achieve subpar performance when the size of the dataset is rather small. In this paper, we investigate the effect of utilizing class label information in the AVC feature learning task. We modified various positive and negative data sampling techniques of SSL based on class label information to investigate the effect on the feature quality. We propose a new sampling approach which we call soft-positive sampling, where the positive pair for one audio sample is not from the exact corresponding video, but from a video of the same class. Experimental results suggest that when the dataset size is small in SSL setup, features learnt through the soft-positive sampling method significantly outperform those from the traditional SSL sampling approaches. This trend holds in both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks, and even outperforms supervised classification. Finally, experiments show that class label information can easily be obtained using a publicly available classifier network and then can be used to boost the SSL performance without adding extra data- annotation burden.",  keywords  = "audio-video data, sampling strategies, self-supervised learning, soft-positive",  author    = "Shanshan Wang and Soumya Tripathy and Toni Heittola and Annamaria Mesaros",  note      = "Publisher Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2024 IEEE.; IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops ; Conference date: 14-04-2024 Through 19-04-2024",  year      = "2024",  doi       = "10.1109/ICASSPW62465.2024.10626141",  language  = "English",  pages     = "545--549",  booktitle = "2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops, ICASSPW 2024 - Proceedings",  publisher = "IEEE",  address   = "United States"}

The limitation is particularly in scenarios with large distributed microphone arrays with varying speaker-to-microphone distances or compact, highly directional microphone arrays where speaker or microphone positions change over time. Current mask-based methods often fix the reference channel during training, which makes it not possible to adaptively select the reference channel for optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an adaptive approach for selecting the optimal reference channel. Our method leverages a multi-channel masking-based scheme, where multiple masked signals are combined to generate a single-channel output signal. This enhanced signal is then used for loss calculation, while the reference clean speech is adjusted based on the highest scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR).

Most studies predominantly center on employing a classification approach, where distances are discretized into distinct categories, enabling smoother model training and achieving higher accuracy but imposing restrictions on the precision of the obtained sound source position. Towards this direction, in this paper we propose a novel approach for continuous distance estimation from audio signals using a convolutional recurrent neural network with an attention module. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant temporal and spectral features, enhancing its ability to capture fine-grained distance-related information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using audio recordings in controlled environments with three levels of realism (synthetic room impulse response, measured response with convolved speech, and real recordings) on four datasets (our synthetic dataset, QMULTIMIT, VoiceHome-2, and STARSS23).

In general, there is an agreement that CDS has higher pitch mean and variability than ADS (adult-directed speech). However, earlier studies have reported conflicting findings on how F0 of CDS changes with the recipient child{\textquoteright}s age, as there is evidence for both presence and absence of age-related change of pitch variability. One possibility is that the disagreement might originate from the variability of speech behaviors of speakers in different languages and cultures. Alternatively, it could be explained by the F0 measurement methodology as well. In this work, we investigate how the way we measure F0 influences the overall results on CDS change with child age. We investigated two different factors which could influence melodic analysis of speech: a) what sound segments are used to measure F0: vowels, sonorants, voiced obstruents, no account for sound segments; and b) whether the number of words within an utterance is taken into account in the analysis. We used a dataset of maternal utterances from the Providence Corpus (a collection of twice-monthly recordings of hour-long mother-child spontaneous interactions from six NA-English-speaking children) addressed at children in the age range of 1;0 to 3;0. The F0 values were calculated using OpenSMILE toolkit. The transcription-to-speech alignment was performed using WebMAUS online toolkit. The age-dependency of F0 feature was tested by means of the Spearman{\textquoteright}s rank correlation coefficient between quantized child age and the feature values associated with the age bin. The results show that the estimation procedure can affect the findings, potentially affecting developmental interpretations. In case of calculating F0 on either voiced consonants and vowels, or vowels only, there is a significant age-dependent increase of F0 SD. This is in contrast to the case of using all F0 values calculated within an utterance by F0 detection algorithm, when no significant age-dependency for F0 SD is found. Thus, it matters whether we take into account segments that are known to have proper voicing or measure F0 from all speech that an automatic F0 estimator considers as voiced irrespectively of the underlying segments. Second, we found no age-related dependencies of F0 SD (whether we took sound segment identities into account or not) for the scenario where the analysis was controlled for the number of words within an utterance, i.e. comparing one-word utterances across all ages, two-word utterances across all ages, etc. The revealed age-dependency of F0 SD for the first scenario might be explained constantly increasing length of utterances in CDS in terms of number of pronounced words along with a child age.

The modelling encompasses properties of the input data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their algorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to compare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more naturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates development of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step towards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of speech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major drawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is currently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling experiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for the case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) analysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of utterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in English and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an in-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data. Finally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change the conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning model. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality naturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS in terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments.

Here, performance of a wearable system in early motor assessment was validated and compared to developmental tracking of physical growth charts. Methods: Altogether 1358 h of spontaneous movement during 226 recording sessions in 116 infants (age 4–19 months) were analysed using a multisensor wearable system. A deep learning-based automatic pipeline quantified categories of infants' postures and movements at a time scale of seconds. Results from an archived cohort (dataset 1, N = 55 infants) recorded under partial supervision were compared to a validation cohort (dataset 2, N = 61) recorded at infants{\textquoteright} homes by the parents. Aggregated recording-level measures including developmental age prediction (DAP) were used for comparison between cohorts. The motor growth was also compared with respective DAP estimates based on physical growth data (length, weight, and head circumference) obtained from a large cohort (N = 17,838 infants; age 4–18 months). Findings: Age-specific distributions of posture and movement categories were highly similar between infant cohorts. The DAP scores correlated tightly with age, explaining 97–99\% (94–99\% CI 95) of the variance at the group average level, and 80–82\% (72–88\%) of the variance in the individual recordings. Both the average motor and the physical growth measures showed a very strong fit to their respective developmental models (R2 = 0.99). However, single measurements showed more modality-dependent variation that was lowest for motor (σ = 1.4 [1.3–1.5 CI 95] months), length (σ = 1.5 months), and combined physical (σ = 1.5 months) measurements, and it was clearly higher for the weight (σ = 1.9 months) and head circumference (σ = 1.9 months) measurements. Longitudinal tracking showed clear individual trajectories, and its accuracy was comparable between motor and physical measures with longer measurement intervals. Interpretation: A quantified, transparent and explainable assessment of infants' motor performance is possible with a fully automated analysis pipeline, and the results replicate across independent cohorts from out-of-hospital recordings. A holistic assessment of motor development provides an accuracy that is comparable with the conventional physical growth measures. A quantitative measure of infants{\textquoteright} motor development may directly support individual diagnostics and care, as well as facilitate clinical research as an outcome measure in early intervention trials.

The foundation of this study is a parametric rendering framework, which can operate either on arbitrary microphone array room impulse responses (RIRs) or Ambisonic RIRs. Spatial filtering techniques are used to decompose the input RIR into individual reflections and anisotropic diffuse reverberation, which are reproduced using dedicated rendering strategies. The proposed approach operates by considering several hypotheses involving different rendering configurations and thereafter determining which hypothesis reconstructs the input RIR most faithfully. With regard to the present study, these hypotheses involved considering different potential reflection numbers. Once the optimal number of reflections to render has been determined over time and frequency, the array directional responses used to reconstruct the input RIR are substituted with spatialization gains for the target playback setup. The results of formal listening experiments suggest that the proposed approach produces renderings that are perceptually more similar to reference responses, when compared with the use of an established subspace-based detection algorithm. The proposed approach also demonstrates similar or better performance than that achieved with existing state-of-the-art methods.",  author    = "Leo McCormack and Nils Meyer-Kahlen and Archontis Politis",  note      = "Publisher Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2023 Audio Engineering Society.

This study investigates the use of different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant motility data from wearable sensors.

In addition, we explore the benefits of data augmentation methods in ideal and nonideal recording conditions. The experiments are conducted using a dataset of multisensor movement recordings from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the best performance was obtained with parallel two-dimensional convolutions for intrasensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier performance. Comparison of time series models revealed that feedforward dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance.

However, since large-scale daylong audio is initially unannotated and differs from typical speech corpora from controlled environments, there are no existing in-domain SER systems for the task. Based on existing literature, it is also unclear what is the best approach to deploy a SER system for a new domain. Consequently, in this study, we investigated alternative strategies for deploying a SER system for large-scale child-centered audio recordings from a neonatal hospital environment, comparing cross-corpus generalization, active learning (AL), and domain adaptation (DA) methods in the process. We first conducted simulations with existing emotion-labeled speech corpora to find the best strategy for SER system deployment. We then tested how the findings generalize to our new initially unannotated dataset. As a result, we found that the studied AL method provided overall the most consistent results, being less dependent on the specifics of the training corpora or speech features compared to the alternative methods. However, in situations without the possibility to annotate data, unsupervised DA proved to be the best approach.

These were further supplemented by, and compared with, prosodic features using a popular compact feature set and standard MFCC. Temporal characteristics of these features were modeled by convolutional neural networks. Besides the features, we were also interested in the speech tasks for collecting data for automatic PD speech assessment, like sustained vowels, text reading, and spontaneous monologue. For this, we utilized a recently collected Finnish PD corpus (PDSTU) as well as a Spanish database (PC-GITA). The experiments were formulated as regression problems against expert ratings of PD-related symptoms, including ratings of speech intelligibility, voice impairment, overall severity of communication disorder on PDSTU, as well as on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) on PC-GITA. The experimental results show: 1) the speech attribute features can well indicate the severity of pathologies in parkinsonian speech; 2) combining phonation features with articulatory features improves the PD assessment performance, but requires high-quality recordings to be applicable; 3) read speech leads to more accurate automatic ratings than the use of sustained vowels, but not if the amount of speech is limited to correspond to the sustained vowels in duration; and 4) jointly using data from several speech tasks can further improve the automatic PD assessment performance.",  author    = "Yuanyuan Liu and Kiran Mittapalle and Nelly Penttil{\"a} and Tiina Ihalainen and Paavo Alku and Okko R{\"a}s{\"a}nen",  year      = "2023",  doi       = "10.1109/TASLP.2022.3212829",  language  = "English",  volume    = "31",  pages     = "242--255",  journal   = "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing",  issn      = "2329-9290",  publisher = "IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity"}

Existing widely-available multi-channel audio compression codecs are not designed to consider the characteristic inter-channel relations inherent to the Ambisonics format, and thus may not leverage this knowledge to optimise the compression. Therefore, this article proposes a spatial audio compression algorithm, based on a novel reformulation of the Higher-Order Directional Audio Coding (HO-DirAC) method, which is specifically intended for compressing higher-order Ambisonic audio streams. The methodology builds upon the concept of a spherical filter bank acting in the spherical harmonic domain. This results in directionally constrained sound-field estimates and parameterization, which may be utilized to reconstruct the input Ambisonic signals with minimal perceived loss of quality. The results of a listening experiment indicate high perceptual quality when using six or more audio transport channels to deliver fifth-order (36 channels) Ambisonic sound scenes.

We study how the model{\textquoteright}s latent representations reflect phonemic, lexical, and semantic knowledge as a function of language experience. We also test how the findings vary with differential emphasis on the two learning mechanisms. As a result, we find phonemic learning always starting to emerge before lexical learning, followed by semantics. However, there is also notable overlap in their development. The same pattern emerges irrespectively of the emphasis on auditory or audiovisual learning.

Recently, the model-based higher-order directional audio coding (HO-DirAC) method was formulated for HOA input to HOA output. Compression is achieved by reducing the number of audio transport channels through spatial discretization. These transport channels are then used to reconstruct the scene on the receiving end based on accompanying spatial metadata. This reconstructed scene may also be optionally upmixed to a higher-order; leading to an enhancement in spatial-resolution. In this paper, the authors analyze certain sound-scenes that were especially challenging for the previously proposed HO-DirAC framework, which the authors postulate could be attributed to the lower-order reconstruction of diffuse sound-field components. Three optimizations for HO-DirAC are proposed, which all employ optimal adaptive mixing and/or energy matching of Ambisonic components based on spatial covariance matrices. The methods are formulated such that they are applied directly in the reconstruction of HOA from the spatially discrete transport audio signals. Notably, a dedicated low-complexity solution without additional side-information is derived. Instrumental evaluations confirm a reduced reconstruction error when using either of the proposed optimizations.

Initially, the source separation network filters out some of the privacy-sensitive data, and during the adversarial learning process, the system will learn privacy-preserving representation on the filtered signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing our method against systems without source separation, without adversarial learning, and without both.

Nonetheless, it is still unclear which set of constraints and problem formulation is the most appropriate in practice. In this paper, we design a general framework for deriving spectrogram inversion algorithm, which is based on formulating optimization problems by combining these objectives either as soft penalties or hard constraints.

The proposed method measures spatial parameters in the time-frequency domain that summarize the scene at the microphone positions.

The presented results show that the use of specific binaural features, mainly the Generalized Cross Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-phat) and sines and cosines of phase differences, result in a better performing model in both separate and joint tasks as compared with baseline methods based on logmel energies only.",  keywords  = "sound event detection, acoustic scene classification, deep neural networks, binaural audio",  author    = "Daniel Krause and Annamaria Mesaros",  note      = "jufoid=55867; European Signal Processing Conference ; Conference date: 29-08-2022 Through 02-09-2022",  year      = "2022",  month     = sep,  day       = "1",  doi       = "10.23919/EUSIPCO55093.2022.9909581",  language  = "English",  series    = "European Signal Processing Conference",  publisher = "IEEE",  pages     = "399--403",  booktitle = "2022 30th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)",  address   = "United States"}

Data-based methods are those that operate directly on the spatial information carried by audio signals. This is in contrast to model-based methods, which impose spatial information from, for example, metadata like the intended position of a source onto signals that are otherwise free of spatial information. Signal processing has traditionally been at the core of spatial audio systems, and it continues to play a very important role. The irruption of deep learning in many closely related fields has put the focus on the potential of learning-based approaches for the development of data-based spatial audio applications. This article reviews the most important application domains of data-based spatial audio including well-established methods that employ conventional signal processing while paying special attention to the most recent achievements that make use of machine learning. Our review is organized based on the topology of the spatial audio pipeline that consist in capture, processing/manipulation, and reproduction. The literature on the three stages of the pipeline is discussed, as well as on the spatial audio representations that are used to transmit the content between them, highlighting the key references and elaborating on the underlying concepts.

These sound objects are subsequently spatialized over the target playback setup, with respect to both the head orientation and position of the listener. The diffuse ambience of the scene is rendered separately by first spatially subtracting the source signals from the receivers located nearest to the listener position. The resultant residual Ambisonic signals are then spatialized, decorrelated, and summed together with suitable interpolation weights. The proposed system is evaluated through an in situ listening test conducted in 6DoF virtual reality, whereby real-world sound sources are compared with the auralization achieved through the proposed rendering method.

It is demonstrated, through objective and subjective evaluations, that the proposed enhancements in the majority of cases produce binaural signals that more closely resemble the spatial characteristics of simulated reference signals when the enhancement is applied to and compared against the three suggested starting binaural rendering approaches.

The enhancement approach involves the post-processing of an initial estimate of the binaural signals, in order to obtain a refined esti- mate of binaural signals which more closely represent the inter-aural cues corresponding to the sound-field model. In this contribution, the enhancement approach has been implemented as an open-source framework, written in both the MATLAB and C programming languages, and as a real-time audio plug-in.

Without further assumptions, directional receivers, such as a spherical microphone array (SMA), can estimate the direction of arrival (DoA), but not reliably estimate sound-source distance. By utilizing multiple, distributed SMAs, further methods are available that directly infer the position in 3-D space. Typically used DoA intersection by triangulation delivers problematically noisy estimates, therefore, statistical filters are better suited. In this study, we compare the performance of different DoA to position tracking strategies. DoA angles suffer from the well-known angle wrapping problem, which is especially problematic in Gaussian filters. However, these filters are attractive due to their low computational complexity. Using circular and spherical statistics, the non- linear extensions of the Kalman filter can be formulated to explicitly treat the discontinuity of DoA angles. Furthermore, we introduce a time adaptive regularization of the filter update by the instantaneous sound-field diffuseness estimate. An experiment with three first-order SMAs in a reverberant room shows an improved distance error compared to the mean DoA intersection baseline. The results highlight the importance of treating the angle wrapping and the stabilization when incorporating the sound-field diffuseness estimate.

While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the exact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet remains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic comprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech and concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate without prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units, and without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has raised the question whether knowledge of linguistic units, such as phone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent representations supporting the translation between speech and representations in other modalities, and instead of the units ever being proximal learning goals for the learner. In this study, formulate this idea as the so-called latent language hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review the extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing computational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning simulations with different neural network models for audiovisual cross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real speech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the networks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by utilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic selectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations. As a result, we find that representations associated with phonetic, syllabic, and lexical units of speech indeed emerge from the audiovisual learning process. The finding is also robust against variations in model architecture or characteristics of model training and testing data.

We propose a dictionary which is a linear combination of speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability. The dictionary is parametric and all atoms depend on a small number of parameters. The speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability are learned from recordings of tens or hundreds of speakers. We show that the proposed method can be applied to the single-channel speech separation task where two speakers of unknown identity are to be separated. In a scenario where the unknown speakers{\textquoteright} recordings are in training dataset together with recordings of many other speakers, we show that the proposed method outperforms stacked NMD (NMD with a dictionary which contains atoms of all speakers in the dataset) in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). DANMD was also tested in a scenario where recordings of the recognized speakers were not in the training dataset. In this case it brought clearly positive signal-to-distortion ratios. The proposed model was also tested for a co-channel speaker identification task, where the parameters of the adapted model are a basis for a decision about the identity of the speakers in the mixture.

For example, if someone thinks you are sad today, they might reply to your {"}why?{"}with {"}because you were so Hmmmmm-mmm-mmm{"}. Today's Artificial Intelligence (AI), however, is - if at all - largely providing explanations of decisions in a visual or textual manner. While such approaches are good for communication via visual media such as in research papers or screens of intelligent devices, they may not always be the best way to explain; especially when the end user is not an expert. In particular, when the AI's task is about Audio Intelligence, visual explanations appear less intuitive than audible, sonified ones. Sonification has also great potential for explainable AI (XAI) in systems that deal with non-audio data - for example, because it does not require visual contact or active attention of a user. Hence, sonified explanations of AI decisions face a challenging, yet highly promising and pioneering task. That involves incorporating innovative XAI algorithms to allow pointing back at the learning data responsible for decisions made by an AI, and to include decomposition of the data to identify salient aspects. It further aims to identify the components of the preprocessing, feature representation, and learnt attention patterns that are responsible for the decisions. Finally, it targets decision-making at the model-level, to provide a holistic explanation of the chain of processing in typical pattern recognition problems from end-to-end. Sonified AI explanations will need to unite methods for sonification of the identified aspects that benefit decisions, decomposition and recomposition of audio to sonify which parts in the audio were responsible for the decision, and rendering attention patterns and salient feature representations audible. Benchmarking sonified XAI is challenging, as it will require a comparison against a backdrop of existing, state-of-the-art visual and textual alternatives, as well as synergistic complementation of all modalities in user evaluations. Sonified AI explanations will need to target different user groups to allow personalisation of the sonification experience for different user needs, to lead to a major breakthrough in comprehensibility of AI via hearing how decisions are made, hence supporting tomorrow's humane AI's trustability.

A key measure to quantify from such data is the amount of speech present in children{\textquoteright}s home environments. To this end, the LENA recorder and software—a popular system for measuring linguistic input—estimates the number of adult words that children may hear over the course of a recording. However, word count estimation is challenging to do in a language- independent manner; the relationship between observable acoustic patterns and language-specific lexical entities is far from uniform across human languages. In this paper, we ask whether some alternative linguistic units, namely phone(me)s or syllables, could be measured instead of, or in parallel with, words in order to achieve improved cross-linguistic applicability and comparability of an automated system for measuring child language input. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of measuring different units from theoretical and technical points of view. We also investigate the practical applicability of measuring such units using a novel system called Automatic LInguistic unit Count Estimator (ALICE) together with audio from seven child-centered daylong audio corpora from diverse cultural and linguistic environments. We show that language-independent measurement of phoneme counts is somewhat more accurate than syllables or words, but all three are highly correlated with human annotations on the same data.

We find reasonably high accuracy in some measures (AWC, CVC), with more problematic levels of performance in others (CTC, precision of male adults and other children). Statistical analyses do not support the view that performance is worse for children who are dissimilar from the LENAⓇ original training set.

Acoustic features measuring vowel articulation have been demonstrated to be effective indicators of PD in its assessment. Standard clinical vowel articulation features of vowel working space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formants centralization ratio (FCR), are derived the first two formants of the three corner vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/. Conventionally, manual annotation of the corner vowels from speech data is required before measuring vowel articulation. This process is time-consuming. The present work aims to reduce human effort in clinical analysis of PD speech by proposing an automatic pipeline for vowel articulation assessment. The method is based on automatic corner vowel detection using a language universal phoneme recognizer, followed by statistical analysis of the formant data. The approach removes the restrictions of prior knowledge of speaking content and the language in question. Experimental results on a Finnish PD speech corpus demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed automatic method in deriving VAI, VSA, FCR and F2i/F2u (the second formant ratio for vowels /i/ and /u/). The automatically computed parameters are shown to be highly correlated with features computed with manual annotations of corner vowels. In addition, automatically and manually computed vowel articulation features have comparable correlations with experts' ratings on speech intelligibility, voice impairment and overall severity of communication disorder. Language-independence of the proposed approach is further validated on a Spanish PD database, PC-GITA, as well as on TORGO corpus of English dysarthric speech.

We predict the pass-by instants of vehicles from local minima of clipped vehicle-to-microphone distance. This distance is predicted from audio using a two-stage (coarse-fine) regression, with both stages realised via neural networks (NNs). Experiments show that the NN-based distance regression outperforms by far the previously proposed support vector regression. The 95\% confidence interval for the mean of vehicle counting error is within [0.28\%, −0.55\%].

A large-scale realistic dataset of spatialized sound events was generated for the challenge, to be used for training of learning-based approaches, and for evaluation of the submissions in an unlabeled subset. The overview presents in detail how the systems were evaluated and ranked and the characteristics of the best-performing systems. Common strategies in terms of input features, model architectures, training approaches, exploitation of prior knowledge, and data augmentation are discussed. Since ranking in the challenge was based on individually evaluating localization and event classification performance, part of the overview focuses on presenting metrics for the joint measurement of the two, together with a reevaluation of submissions using these new metrics. The new analysis reveals submissions that performed better on the joint task of detecting the correct type of event close to its original location than some of the submissions that were ranked higher in the challenge.

The mixing matrices required to combine these signals, in a manner whereby the resulting output signals exhibit the target inter-channel relationships for an incoherently spread source, are computed based on an optimised solution which is constrained to preserve signal fidelity. The proposed solution is evaluated in the context of producing extended sound sources for binaural playback. Objective perceptual metrics are computed and shown to be comparable to those derived from an ideal incoherently spread reference.

Therefore, the sphere is spatially partitioned into components that should ideally reconstruct the unit sphere. When distributing such sectors uniformly on the sphere, their set makes up a bank of spatial filters, i. e. a spatial filter bank. These sectors can be conveniently designed in the spherical harmonic domain such that each sector preserves the local properties of the acoustic energy-density. These traits have enabled recent improvements in the parameterization of higher-order Ambisonics, e.g. for spatial audio reproduction, multi-source analysis, and sound field visualization. However, when using a set of these sectors as a spatial filter bank, their spatial interaction incurs a scaling error if the reconstructed sound field is not properly compensated. This paper presents the methodology for designing a set of spatial filters in the spherical harmonic domain, which uniformly partition the sphere. Furthermore, a new corresponding compensation factor is derived enabling amplitude or energy preservation of the input sound field.

Different ways of processing multichannel audio data in the time-frequency domain using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are described and tested with the aim to provide a comparative study of their performance. In most considered approaches, models are trained with phase and magnitude components of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In addition to state-of-the-art 2D convolutional layers, we investigate several solutions for the processing of 3D matrices containing multichannel complex representation of the microphone signals. The first two proposed approaches are the 3D convolutions and depthwise separable convolutions in which two types of filters are used to exploit information within and between the channels. Note that this paper presents the first application of depthwise separable convolutions in a task of sound source localization.

Previously, novel wearable technology has shown promise for offering efficient, scalable and automated methods for movement assessment in adults. Here, we describe the development of an infant wearable, a multi-sensor smart jumpsuit that allows mobile accelerometer and gyroscope data collection during movements. Using this suit, we first recorded play sessions of 22 typically developing infants of approximately 7 months of age. These data were manually annotated for infant posture and movement based on video recordings of the sessions, and using a novel annotation scheme specifically designed to assess the overall movement pattern of infants in the given age group. A machine learning algorithm, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was then trained for automatic detection of posture and movement classes using the data and annotations. Our experiments show that the setup can be used for quantitative tracking of infant movement activities with a human equivalent accuracy, i.e., it meets the human inter-rater agreement levels in infant posture and movement classification.

Eye tracking was used to measure oculomotor orienting to peripheral visual stimuli and attention disengagement from central stimuli at 8 months (Tampere) or at 6 months (Cape Town) of age. Only a marginal positive correlation between fundamental frequency of cry (F0) and visual attention disengagement was observed in the Tampere cohort, but not in the Cape Town cohort. This correlation indicated that infants from the Tampere cohort with a higher neonatal F0 were marginally slower to shift their gaze away from the central stimulus to the peripheral stimulus.

Most audio captioning methods are based on deep neural networks, employing an encoder-decoder scheme and a dataset with audio clips and corresponding natural language descriptions (i.e. captions). A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of words in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically non-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. {"}a{"}, {"}the{"}), and other words are infrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns). In this paper we propose two methods to mitigate this class imbalance problem. First, in an autoencoder setting for audio captioning, we weigh each word's contribution to the training loss inversely proportional to its number of occurrences in the whole dataset. Secondly, in addition to multi-class, word-level audio captioning task, we define a multi-label side task based on clip-level content word detection by training a separate decoder. We use the loss from the second task to regularize the jointly trained encoder for the audio captioning task.

In particular, the multiple input spectrogram inversion (MISI) algorithm has been exploited successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter.

Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals.

In this work we present an approach that focuses on explicitly taking advantage of this difference of lengths between sequences, by applying a temporal sub-sampling to the audio input sequence.

In the existing UTD systems, the optimal hyperparameters may differ across datasets, limiting their applicability to new corpora and truly low-resource scenarios.

One key application of WCE is to measure language input heard by infants and toddlers in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings from microphones worn by the infants. Although WCE is nearly trivial for high-quality signals in high-resource languages, daylong recordings are substantially more challenging due to the unconstrained acoustic environments and the presence of near- and far-field speech. Moreover, many use cases of interest involve languages for which reliable ASR systems or even well-defined lexicons are not available. A good WCE system should also perform similarly for low- and high-resource languages in order to enable unbiased comparisons across different cultures and environments. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art solution, the LENA system, is based on proprietary software and has only been optimized for American English, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we build on existing work on WCE and present the steps we have taken towards a freely available system for WCE that can be adapted to different languages or dialects with a limited amount of orthographically transcribed speech data. Our system is based on language-independent syllabification of speech, followed by a language-dependent mapping from syllable counts (and a number of other acoustic features) to the corresponding word count estimates. We evaluate our system on samples from daylong infant recordings from six different corpora consisting of several languages and socioeconomic environments, all manually annotated with the same protocol to allow direct comparison. We compare a number of alternative techniques for the two key components in our system: speech activity detection and automatic syllabification of speech. As a result, we show that our system can reach relatively consistent WCE accuracy across multiple corpora and languages (with some limitations). In addition, the system outperforms LENA on three of the four corpora consisting of different varieties of English.

Parametric methods operate by analysing a set of spatial parameters, dividing the response into components based on an assumed sound-field model, and rendering the components to the loudspeaker array using techniques informed by the analysis. For a direct/diffuse model, the sound is divided into non- diffuse and diffuse components, which are reproduced using directional and surrounding reproduction methods, respectively. In many cases, the input is first divided into frequency bands for the analysis and reproduction. In this article, a method capable of accommodating higher-order spherical harmonic input is proposed, which, based upon initial testing, appears to overcome some of the limitations exhibited by existing methods. The proposed approach operates by partitioning the sound-field into multiple directionally biased sectors, which are then analysed independently. The non-diffuse components are reproduced individually for each sector using amplitude-panning, whereas the diffuse components are encoded back into the spherical harmonic domain, and subsequently reproduced via linear decoding, followed by decorrelation.

The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines.

Delay-based reverberators can produce a realistic effect at a reasonable computational cost. While the recent popularity of spatial audio algorithms is mainly related to the reproduction of the perceived direction of sound sources, there is also a need to spatialize the reverberant sound field. Usually multichannel reverberation algorithms output a series of decorrelated signals yielding an isotropic energy decay. This means that the reverberation time is uniform in all directions. However, the acoustics of physical spaces can exhibit more complex direction-dependent characteristics. This paper proposes a new method to control the directional distribution of energy over time, within a delay-based reverberator, capable of producing a directional impulse response with anisotropic energy decay. We present a method using multichannel delay lines in conjunction with a direction-dependent transform in the spherical harmonic domain to control the direction-dependent decay of the late reverberation. The new reverberator extends the feedback delay network, retaining its time-frequency domain characteristics.

In this study, we aim to provide a general SSC system for converting styles with varying vocal effort and focus on normal-to-Lombard conversion as a case study of this problem. We propose a parametric approach that uses a vocoder to extract speech features. These features are mapped using parallel machine learning models from utterances spoken in normal style to the corresponding features of Lombard speech. Finally, the mapped features are converted to a Lombard speech waveform with the vocoder. A total of three vocoders (GlottDNN, STRAIGHT, and Pulse model in log domain (PML)) and three machine learning mapping methods (standard GMM, Bayesian GMM, and feed-forward DNN) were compared in the proposed normal-to-Lombard style conversion system. The conversion was evaluated using two subjective listening tests measuring perceived Lombardness and quality of the converted speech signals, and by using an instrumental measure called Speech Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB) for speech intelligibility evaluation under various noise levels. The results of the subjective tests show that the system is able to convert normal speech into Lombard speech and that there is a trade-off between quality and Lombardness of the mapped utterances. The GlottDNN and PML stand out as the best vocoders in terms of quality and Lombardness, respectively, whereas the DNN is the best mapping method in terms of Lombardness. PML with the standard GMM seems to give a good compromise between the two attributes.

Drawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian source model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us to favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov chain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex Itakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of non-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a distortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which preserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables one to account for some phase constraints.

A similar study is also done with the binaural and single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development dataset. The proposed method learns to recognize overlapping sound events from multichannel features faster and performs better SED with a fewer number of training epochs.

It is used by the audio engineering community for decades for audio recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the recording practice itself. But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For all the above cases we calculate the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric.

This approach, in which the phase of the original mixture is assigned to each component, is limited when sources overlap in the TF domain. In this paper, we propose to improve this technique by accounting for two properties of the phase. First, we model the sources by anisotropic Gaussian variables: This model accounts for the non-uniformity of the phase, and permits us to incorporate some prior information about the phase that originates from a sinusoidal model. Second, we exploit the STFT consistency, which is the relationship between STFT coefficients that is due to the redundancy of the STFT. We derive a conjugate gradient algorithm for estimating the corresponding filter, which we refer to as the consistent anisotropic Wiener filter.

Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom.

A three-dimensional tensor factorization is able to take advantage of these redundant patterns, and is used to separate a mixture into an approximated sum of components by minimizing a divergence cost. Furthermore, we show that the basic tensor factorization can be extended with convolution in time being used to improve separation results and provide update rules to learn components in such a manner. Following factorization, sources are reconstructed in the audio domain from estimated components using a novel approach based on reconstruction masks that are learned using MS activations, and then applied to a mixture spectrogram.

The proposed processing is separating the scene into a sum of small number of sources, and the spectrogram of each of them is in turn represented as a small number of latent components. The direction of arrival (DOA) of each source is estimated, which is followed by binaural rendering of each source at its estimated direction. For representing the sources, the proposed method uses low-rank complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization combined with DOA-based spatial covariance matrix model. The binaural reconstruction is achieved by applying the binaural cues (head-related transfer function) associated with the estimated source DOA to the separated source signals. The binaural rendering quality of the proposed method was evaluated using a speech intelligibility test. The test results indicated that the proposed binaural rendering was able to improve the intelligibility of speech over stereo recordings and separation by minimum variance distortionless response beamformer with the same binaural synthesis in a three-speaker scenario. An additional listening test evaluating the subjective quality of the rendered output indicates no added processing artifacts by the proposed method in comparison to unprocessed stereo recording.",  keywords  = "Binaural processing, Source separation, Speech intelligibility, Non-negative matrix factorization",  author    = "Joonas Nikunen and Aleksandr Diment and Tuomas Virtanen and Miikka Vilermo",  year      = "2016",  doi       = "10.1016/j.specom.2015.09.005",  language  = "English",  volume    = "76",  pages     = "157–169",  journal   = "Speech Communication",  issn      = "0167-6393",  publisher = "Elsevier B.V."}

Their drawback is the high computational load. In this work, we propose a novel cascaded classifier structure to speed up the decision process while utilizing sparse signal representation. In particular, we apply the cascaded decision process for noise robust automatic speech recognition task. The cascaded decision process is implemented using a feedforward neural network (NN) and time sparse versions of a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based sparse classification method of [1]. The recognition accuracy of our cascade is among the three best in the recent CHiME2013 benchmark and obtains six times faster the accuracy of NMF alone as in [1].",  author    = "Katariina Mahkonen and Antti Hurmalainen and Tuomas Virtanen and Joni-Kristian K{\"a}m{\"a}r{\"a}inen",  year      = "2016",  doi       = "10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760660",  language  = "English",  publisher = "IEEE",  booktitle = "European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2016",  address   = "United States",  note      = "European Signal Processing Conference ; Conference date: 01-01-1900"}

For practical purposes involving human listeners, a 20 ms algorithmic delay is the uppermost limit which is comfortable to the listener. In this paper, we propose a low-latency (algorithmic delay <20 ms) deep neural network (DNN) based source separation method. The proposed method takes advantage of an extended past context, outputting soft time-frequency masking filters which are then applied to incoming audio frames to give better separation performance as compared to NMF baseline. Acoustic mixtures from five pairs of speakers from CMU Arctic database [1] were used for the experiments. At least 1 dB average improvement in source to distortion ratios (SDR) was observed in our DNN-based system over a low-latency NMF baseline for different processing and analysis frame lengths. The effect of incorporating previous temporal context into DNN inputs yielded significant improvements in SDR for short processing frame lengths.",  author    = "Gaurav Naithani and Giambattista Parascandolo and Thomas Barker and Pontoppidan, \{Niels Henrik\} and Tuomas Virtanen",  year      = "2016",  doi       = "10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905846",  language  = "English",  pages     = "272--276",  booktitle = "IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing, 2016",  publisher = "IEEE",  address   = "United States",  note      = "IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing ; Conference date: 01-01-1900"}

The system output in this case contains overlapping events, marked as multiple sounds detected as being active at the same time. The polyphonic system output requires a suitable procedure for evaluation against a reference. Metrics from neighboring fields such as speech recognition and speaker diarization can be used, but they need to be partially redefined to deal with the overlapping events. We present a review of the most common metrics in the field and the way they are adapted and interpreted in the polyphonic case. We discuss segment-based and event-based definitions of each metric and explain the consequences of instance-based and class-based averaging using a case study. In parallel, we provide a toolbox containing implementations of presented metrics.",  keywords  = "Audio content analysis, Audio signal processing, Computational auditory scene analysis, Evaluation of sound event detection, Everyday sounds, Pattern recognition, Polyphonic sound event detection, Sound events",  author    = "Annamaria Mesaros and Toni Heittola and Tuomas Virtanen",  year      = "2016",  doi       = "10.3390/app6060162",  language  = "English",  volume    = "6",  journal   = "Applied Sciences",  issn      = "2076-3417",  publisher = "MDPI",  number    = "6"}

Real life sound recordings typically have many overlapping sound events, making it hard to recognize with just mono channel audio. Human listeners have been successfully recognizing the mixture of overlapping sound events using pitch cues and exploiting the stereo (multichannel) audio signal available at their ears to spatially localize these events. Traditionally SED systems have only been using mono channel audio, motivated by the human listener we propose to extend them to use multichannel audio. The proposed SED system is compared against the state of the art mono channel method on the development subset of TUT sound events detection 2016 database.
