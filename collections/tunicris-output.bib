title     = "A pipeline for stochastic and controlled generation of realistic language input for simulating infant language acquisition",
abstract  = "Computational models of early language development involve implementing theories of learning as functional learning algorithms, exposing these models to realistic language input, and comparing learning outcomes to those in infants. While recent research has made major strides in developing more powerful learning models and evaluation protocols grounded in infant data, models are still predominantly trained with non-naturalistic input data, such as crowd-sourced read speech or text transcripts. This is due to the lack of suitable child-directed speech (CDS) corpora in terms of scale and quality. In parallel, the question of how properties and individual variability in language input affect learning outcomes is an active area of empirical research, underlining the need for realistic yet controllable data for modeling such phenomena. This paper presents a solution to the training data problem through stochastic generation of naturalistic CDS data using statistical models, thereby enabling controlled computational simulations with naturalistic input. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the approach by showing how naturalistic CDS transcripts can be generated with a language model conditioned on recipient information (here, infant age), and how text-to-speech systems can be used to convert the transcripts to high-quality speech with a controllable speaking style. We also conduct modeling experiments with generated speech corpora by varying different aspects of the data, showing how this maps into different learning outcomes, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for controlled language learning simulations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of using synthetic data in general, and of the present proof-of-concept pipeline in particular.",

abstract  = "Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly spearheading recent advances on a variety of tasks that fall under the purview of computer audition—i.e., the use of machines to understand sounds. They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose FMs for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines toward auditory FMs. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.",

title     = "Simulating prenatal language exposure in computational models: An exploration study",
abstract  = "Researchers have hypothesized that infant language learning starts from the third trimester of pregnancy. This is supported by studies with fetuses and newborns showing discrimination/preference for their native language. Jointly with empirical research, initial computational modeling studies have investigated whether learning language patterns from speech input benefits from auditory prenatal language exposure (PLE), showing some advantages for prior adaptation to speech-like patterns. However, these modeling studies have not modeled prenatal speech input in an ecologically representative manner regarding quality or quantity. This study describes an ecologically representative framework for modeling PLE for full-term and preterm infants. The approach is based on empirical estimates of the amount of prenatal speech input together with a model of speech signal attenuation from the external air to the fetus{\textquoteright} auditory system. Using this framework, we conduct language learning simulations with computational models that learn from acoustic speech input in an unsupervised manner. We compare the effects of PLE to standard learning from only postnatal input on various early language phenomena. The results show how incorporating PLE can affect models{\textquoteright} learning outcomes, including differences between full-term and preterm conditions. Moreover, PLE duration might influence model behavior, depending on the linguistic capability being tested. While the inclusion of PLE did not improve the compatibility of the tested models with empirical infant data, our study highlights the relevance of PLE as a factor in modeling studies. Moreover, it provides a basic framework for modeling the prenatal period in future computational studies.",

We studied the extent to which early words can be acquired through statistical learning from regularities in audiovisual sensory input. We simulated word learning in infants up to 12 months of age in a realistic setting, using a model that solely learns from statistical regularities in unannotated raw speech and pixel-level visual input. Crucially, the quantity of object naming events was carefully designed to match that accessible to infants of comparable ages. Results show that the model effectively learns to recognize words and associate them with corresponding visual objects, with a vocabulary growth rate comparable to that observed in infants. The findings support the viability of general statistical learning for early word perception, demonstrating how learning can operate without assuming any prior linguistic capabilities.",

The dataset contains 2061 video clips constituting a total of 28.8 hours. We provide up to 5 captions for the audio, visual, and audio-visual content of each clip, crowdsourced separately. Existing datasets focus on a single modality or do not provide modality-specific captions, limiting the study of how each modality contributes to overall comprehension in multimodal settings. Our dataset addresses this critical gap in multimodal research by offering a resource for studying how audio and visual content are captioned individually, as well as how audio-visual content is captioned in relation to these individual modalities. Crowdsourced audio-visual captions are prone to favor visual content over audio content. To avoid this we use large language models (LLMs) to generate three balanced audio-visual captions for each clip based on the crowdsourced captions. We present captioning and retrieval experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of modality-specific captions in evaluating model performance. Specifically, we show that the modality-specific captions allow us to quantitatively assess how well a model understands audio and visual information from a given video. Notably, we find that a model trained on the balanced LLM-generated audio-visual captions captures audio information more effectively compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions. This model achieves a 14\% higher Sentence-BERT similarity on crowdsourced audio captions compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions, which are typically more biased towards visual information. We also discuss the possibilities in multimodal representation learning, question answering, developing new video captioning metrics, and generative AI that this dataset unlocks.

abstract  = "The performance of discriminative machine-learning classifiers, such as neural networks, is limited by training label inconsistencies. Even expert-based annotations can suffer from label inconsistencies, especially in the case of ambiguous phenomena-to-annotate. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, iterative annotation refinement (IAR) 2.0, for refining inconsistent annotations for time-series data. IAR 2.0 uses a procedure that utilizes discriminative classifiers to iteratively combine original annotations with increasingly accurate posterior estimates of classes present in the data. Unlike most existing label refinement approaches, IAR 2.0 offers a simpler yet effective solution for resolving ambiguities in training labels, working with real label noise on time-series data instead of synthetic label noise on image data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through five distinct classification tasks on two highly distinct data modalities. As a result, we show that the labels produced by IAR 2.0 systematically improve classifier performance compared to using the original labels or a previous state-of-the-art method for label refinement. We also conduct a set of controlled simulations to systematically investigate when IAR 2.0 fails to improve on the original training labels. The simulation results demonstrate that IAR 2.0 improves performance in nearly all tested conditions. We also find that the decrease in performance when IAR 2.0 fails is small compared to the average performance gain when IAR 2.0 succeeds, encouraging the use of IAR 2.0 even when the nature of data is unknown.

abstract  = "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers{\textquoteright} time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.",

Current audio-caption datasets (e.g., Clotho) contain audio samples paired with annotated captions, but lack relevance information about audio samples and captions beyond the annotated ones. Besides, mainstream approaches (e.g., CLAP) usually treat the annotated pairs as positives and consider all other audio-caption combinations as negatives, assuming a binary relevance between audio samples and captions. To infer the relevance between audio samples and arbitrary captions, we propose a method that computes non-binary audio-caption relevance scores based on the textual similarities of audio captions. We measure textual similarities of audio captions by calculating the cosine similarity of their Sentence-BERT embeddings and then transform these similarities into audio-caption relevance scores using a logistic function, thereby linking audio samples through their annotated captions to all other captions in the dataset. To integrate the computed relevances into training, we employ a listwise ranking objective, where relevance scores are converted into probabilities of ranking audio samples for a given textual query. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improvements in text-based audio retrieval compared to methods that use binary audio-caption relevances for training.",

title     = "Trade-Offs Between Simplifying Inertial Measurement Unit–Based Movement Recordings and the Attainability of Different Levels of Analyses: Systematic Assessment of Method Variations",
abstract  = "Background: Human movement activity is commonly recorded with inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors in many science disciplines. The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection of different postures and movements, which may support more detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative recording configurations and the attainable analyses of naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal resolution derivative statistics when the data represents naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving infants (N=41; age range 4‐18 months) recorded with a multisensor wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a modest reduction in movement classification performance (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58). Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at relevant temporal resolutions.

abstract  = "Over the last decade, a plethora of training datasets have been compiled for use in language-based machine perception and in human-centered AI, alongside research regarding their compilation methods. From a primarily linguistic perspective, we add to these studies in two ways. First, we provide an overview of sixty-six training datasets used in automatic image, video, and audio captioning, examining their compilation methods with a metadata analysis. Second, we delve into the annotation process of crowdsourced datasets with an interest in understanding the linguistic factors that affect the form and content of the captions, such as contextualization and perspectivation. With a qualitative content analysis, we examine annotator instructions with a selection of eleven datasets. Drawing from various theoretical frameworks that help assess the effectiveness of the instructions, we discuss the visual and textual presentation of the instructions, as well as the perspective-guidance that is an essential part of the language instructions. While our analysis indicates that some standards in the formulation of instructions seem to have formed in the field, we also identified various reoccurring issues potentially hindering readability and comprehensibility of the instructions, and therefore, caption quality. To enhance readability, we emphasize the importance of text structure, organization of the information, consistent use of typographical cues, and clarity of language use. Last, engaging with previous research, we assess the compilation of both web-sourced and crowdsourced captioning datasets from various perspectives, discussing factors affecting the diversity of the datasets.",

title    = "Building a Naturalistic and Representative Affective Speech Corpus for the Finnish Language",
abstract = "Spoken language contains affective (emotional) information, which is conveyed by suprasegmental variation (e.g prosody and phonation) in speech as well as by other situational variation such as word choices along with dialectal, syntactic and semantic variation. The information is ultimately perceived by the listener as subjective interpretations. While affect is part of everyday conversational communication, there is little existing research on expression and perception of affect in spoken Finnish [8][7], not to mention across different idiolectal subgroups such as speakers of different age or dialectal background. Since expression and interpretation of affect in language is known to depend on cultural and social conventions, better understanding of the expression of affect in Finnish would be desirable. The goal of our work is to research how affect is expressed in everyday spoken Finnish using large-scale data. A prerequisite for our research on affective language is a speech corpus containing unscripted audio recordings of speech paired with metadata (or annotations) containing information about the affective expression. However, we are aware of only two Finnish speech corpora related to affect, both consisting of acted emotional expressions while reading a pre-defined script and consisting only a small amount of speech in total [1][5]. In contrast, several large-scale datasets containing unscripted speech in Finnish exists [4][2][6], but they lack affect related metadata. Building an affective speech corpus can be done in several ways, typically by recording acted speech in a controlled setting or utilizing publicly available free speech audio sources from different medias such as podcasts, radio or television. The trade-off when building these types of datasets is typically between the richness and balance of affective expression present in the data and the level of information the dataset contains about the expression in the data [3]. In this presentation, we will describe our approach to compiling a spoken Finnish dataset for the study of affective expression by combining the LahjoitaPuhetta, HelPuhe and TamPuhe datasets. The dataset will be built by aligning the audio recordings with their respective text transcriptions and split into individual utterance samples (consisting of audio and text). Each utterance sample in the dataset will be augmented with a text sentiment, speech-to-noise ratio and audio based emotion estimates first by using automated tools and finally annotating a subset of samples manually. The final dataset can be used to build better tools for automated affect related annotation providing more options for researching affect and idiolectical variation using large-scale data. The work is a part of the CONVERGENCE-project at Tampere University, funded by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation.",

abstract  = "Sound event detection systems are widely used in various applications such as surveillance and environmental monitoring where data is automatically collected, processed, and sent to a cloud for sound recognition. However, this process may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about users or their surroundings, hence raising privacy concerns. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial training method for learning representations of audio recordings that effectively prevents the detection of speech activity from the latent features of the recordings. The proposed method trains a model to generate invariant latent representations of speech-containing audio recordings that cannot be distinguished from non-speech recordings by a speech classifier. The novelty of our work is in the optimization algorithm, where the speech classifier's weights are regularly replaced with the weights of classifiers trained in a supervised manner. This increases the discrimination power of the speech classifier constantly during the adversarial training, motivating the model to generate latent representations in which speech is not distinguishable, even using new speech classifiers trained outside the adversarial training loop. The proposed method is evaluated against a baseline approach with no privacy measures and a prior adversarial training method, demonstrating a significant reduction in privacy violations compared to the baseline approach. Additionally, we show that the prior adversarial method is practically ineffective for this purpose.",

Its properties also change as a function of extralinguistic factors, such as age of the child being addressed. Access to large amounts of representative and varied CDS would be useful for child language research, as this would enable controlled computational modeling experiments of infant language acquisition with realistic input in terms of quality and quantity. In this study, we describe an approach to model age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS using a language model (LM) trained on CDS transcripts and ages of the recipient children, as obtained from North American English corpora of the CHILDES database. The created LM can then be used to stochastically generate synthetic CDS transcripts in an age-appropriate manner, thereby scaling beyond the original datasets in size. We compare characteristics of the generated CDS against the real speech addressed at children of different ages, showing that the LM manages to capture age-dependent changes in CDS, except for a slight difference in the effective vocabulary size. As a side product, we also provide a systematic characterization of age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS in CHILDES, illustrating how all measured aspects of the CDS change with children's age.",

abstract  = "Assessing infant carrying and holding (C/H), or physical infant-caregiver interaction, is important for a wide range of contexts in development research. An automated detection and quantification of infant C/H is particularly needed in long term at-home studies where development of infants{\textquoteright} neurobehavior is measured using wearable devices. Here, we first developed a phenomenological categorization for physical infant-caregiver interactions to support five different definitions of C/H behaviors. Then, we trained and assessed deep learning-based classifiers for their automatic detection from multi-sensor wearable recordings that were originally used for mobile assessment of infants{\textquoteright} motor development. Our results show that an automated C/H detection is feasible at few-second temporal accuracy. With the best C/H definition, the automated detector shows 96\% accuracy and 0.56 kappa, which is slightly less than the video-based inter-rater agreement between trained human experts (98\% accuracy, 0.77 kappa). The classifier performance varies with C/H definition reflecting the extent to which infants{\textquoteright} movements are present in each C/H variant. A systematic benchmarking experiment shows that the widely used actigraphy-based method ignores the normally occurring C/H behaviors. Finally, we show proof-of-concept for the utility of the novel classifier in studying C/H behavior across infant development. Particularly, we show that matching the C/H detections to individuals{\textquoteright} gross motor ability discloses novel insights to infant-parent interaction.",

The network is differentiable, and therefore allows to learn its parameters to maximize speech intelligibility. More generic models based on convolutional layers were tested as well. The performance of the tested architectures was assessed using spectro-temporal objective index (STOI) with hearing-threshold noise and hearing aid speech intelligibility (HASPI) metrics. The dynamic processing network gave a significant improvement of STOI and HASPI in comparison to popular compressive gain prescription rule Camfit. A large enough convolutional network could outperform the interpretable model with the cost of larger computational load.

abstract  = "Long-form audio recordings are increasingly used to study individual variation, group differences, and many other topics in theoretical and applied fields of developmental science, particularly for the description of children{\textquoteright}s language input (typically speech from adults) and children{\textquoteright}s language output (ranging from babble to sentences). The proprietary LENA software has been available for over a decade, and with it, users have come to rely on derived metrics like adult word count (AWC) and child vocalization counts (CVC), which have also more recently been derived using an open-source alternative, the ACLEW pipeline. Yet, there is relatively little work assessing the reliability of long-form metrics in terms of the stability of individual differences across time. Filling this gap, we analyzed eight spoken-language datasets: four from North American English-learning infants, and one each from British English-, French-, American English-/Spanish-, and Quechua-/Spanish-learning infants. The audio data were analyzed using two types of processing software: LENA and the ACLEW open-source pipeline. When all corpora were included, we found relatively low to moderate reliability (across multiple recordings, intraclass correlation coefficient attributed to the child identity [Child ICC], was < 50\% for most metrics). There were few differences between the two pipelines. Exploratory analyses suggested some differences as a function of child age and corpora. These findings suggest that, while reliability is likely sufficient for various group-level analyses, caution is needed when using either LENA or ACLEW tools to study individual variation. We also encourage improvement of extant tools, specifically targeting accurate measurement of individual variation.",

title    = "Modeling Child Language Development using Naturalistic Data at a Scale",
abstract = "These include learning of the language{\textquoteright}s phonetic units, segmentation of words from running speech, association word forms with their meanings, and acquisition of the syntax. Typical empirical research on child language development (CLD) consists of well-controlled focused studies conducted in laboratory conditions. In contrast, only a few high-level theories, like NLM-e (Kuhl et al., 2008) and PRIMIR (Werker \& Curtin, 2005), have aimed to integrate the present understanding of CLD into unified frameworks. However, these frameworks have not gained unanimous acceptance in the field, largely since they are relatively abstract, and only qualitatively describe the mechanisms and representations that could be involved in CLD. As a result, we still have limited understanding of the basic mechanisms and their interactions driving early language acquisition. In principle, computational modelling of CLD is a potential solution to the so-called “integration problem” across empirical findings. This is because computational models can, and must, explicitly address all aspects of the information processing chain from input data to the resulting behavior. By formulating the theories as high-level computational goals and operations, implementing them as functional signal processing and machine learning algorithms, and finally exposing the models to realistic input data comparable to what real infants experience, ecological plausibility and validity of the underlying theories can be explicitly tested. However, the scientific impact of the existing modeling efforts has also been limited. Instead of addressing multiple aspects of language in one model, earlier models have usually focused on individual language phenomena (e.g., phonemic learning or word segmentation). Moreover, they have rarely investigated learning as a function of the developmental timeline of the learner. We argue that two main factors currently hinder the development of more comprehensive, ecologically valid, and thus influential models of CLD: 1) lack of ecologically valid and openly available large-scale speech data to simulate child language experiences at a realistic scale, where various adult speech corpora are currently used instead, and 2) limited validation of the models with respect to empirical data on real infant language learning, where the current standard approach is to evaluate the models against linguistic theory of how speech is formally structured. Without fixing the data and evaluation problems, it is difficult to develop models that could truly help us to understand the big picture of CLD. In this talk, we provide an overview of our ongoing “Modeling Child Language Development using Naturalistic Data at a Scale” (L-SCALE) project, where the aim is to enable development of more comprehensive and ecologically valid computational models of CLD. To achieve this, the L-SCALE project tackles the two challenges identified above: 1) solving the ecologically valid training data problem by creating a pipeline called Generator of Infant Language ExperienceS (GILES) for generation of ecologically relevant large-scale training data for computational models, and 2) solving the mismatch between human data and computational model evaluation by developing evaluation protocols that enable comparison of computational models against empirical data on CLD as a function of learner{\textquoteright}s age. We will also showcase some recent developments of the project, including a proof- of-concept demonstration of the GILES pipeline and a meta-analytic approach to compare models to empirical data on infant language learning. The L-SCALE project is funded by Kone Foundation (2022–2026).",

While most of the existing zero-shot learning methods focused on single-label classification tasks, the present study introduces a method to perform multi-label zero-shot audio classification. To address the challenge of classifying multi-label sounds while generalizing to unseen classes, we adapt temporal attention. The temporal attention mechanism assigns importance weights to different audio segments based on their acoustic and semantic compatibility, thus enabling the model to capture the varying dominance of different sound classes within an audio sample by focusing on the segments most relevant for each class. This leads to more accurate multi-label zero-shot classification than methods employing temporally aggregated acoustic features without weighting, which treat all audio segments equally. We evaluate our approach on a subset of AudioSet against a zero-shot model using uniformly aggregated acoustic features, a zero-rule baseline, and the proposed method in the supervised scenario. Our results show that temporal attention enhances the zero-shot audio classification performance in multi-label scenario.",

abstract  = "Ambisonics encoding of microphone array signals can enable various spatial audio applications, such as virtual reality or telepresence, but it is typically designed for uniformly-spaced spherical microphone arrays. This paper proposes a method for Ambisonics encoding that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate a signal transform from microphone inputs to Ambisonics signals. The approach uses a DNN consisting of a U-Net structure with a learnable preprocessing as well as a loss function consisting of mean average error, spatial correlation, and energy preservation components. The method is validated on two microphone arrays with regular and irregular shapes having four microphones, on simulated reverberant scenes with multiple sources. The results of the validation show that the proposed method can meet or exceed the performance of a conventional signal-independent Ambisonics encoder on a number of error metrics.",

abstract  = "Many multi-source localization and tracking models based on neural networks use one or several recurrent layers at their final stages to track the movement of the sources. Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as the long short-term memories (LSTMs) or the gated recurrent units (GRUs), take a vector as their input and use another vector to store their state. However, this approach results in the information from all the sources being contained in a single ordered vector, which is not optimal for permutation-invariant problems such as multi-source tracking. In this paper, we present a new recurrent architecture that uses unordered sets to represent both its input and its state and that is invariant to the permutations of the input set and equivariant to the permutations of the state set. Hence, the information of every sound source is represented in an individual embedding and the new estimates are assigned to the tracked trajectories regardless of their order.",

abstract  = "In end-to-end multi-channel speech enhancement, the traditional approach of designating one microphone signal as the reference for processing may not always yield optimal results. The limitation is particularly in scenarios with large distributed microphone arrays with varying speaker-to-microphone distances or compact, highly directional microphone arrays where speaker or microphone positions change over time. Current mask-based methods often fix the reference channel during training, which makes it not possible to adaptively select the reference channel for optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an adaptive approach for selecting the optimal reference channel. Our method leverages a multi-channel masking-based scheme, where multiple masked signals are combined to generate a single-channel output signal. This enhanced signal is then used for loss calculation, while the reference clean speech is adjusted based on the highest scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR). The experimental results on the Spear challenge simulated dataset D4 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the conventional approach of using a fixed reference channel with single-channel masking.",

title     = "Speaker Distance Estimation in Enclosures from Single-Channel Audio",
abstract  = "Distance estimation from audio plays a crucial role in various applications, such as acoustic scene analysis, sound source localization, and room modeling. Most studies predominantly center on employing a classification approach, where distances are discretized into distinct categories, enabling smoother model training and achieving higher accuracy but imposing restrictions on the precision of the obtained sound source position. Towards this direction, in this paper we propose a novel approach for continuous distance estimation from audio signals using a convolutional recurrent neural network with an attention module. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant temporal and spectral features, enhancing its ability to capture fine-grained distance-related information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using audio recordings in controlled environments with three levels of realism (synthetic room impulse response, measured response with convolved speech, and real recordings) on four datasets (our synthetic dataset, QMULTIMIT, VoiceHome-2, and STARSS23). Experimental results show that the model achieves an absolute error of 0.11 meters in a noiseless synthetic scenario. Moreover, the results showed an absolute error of about 1.30 meters in the hybrid scenario. The algorithm's performance in the real scenario, where unpredictable environmental factors and noise are prevalent, yields an absolute error of approximately 0.50 meters.",

title    = "The effect of F0 measurements on prosody analysis in language development studies",
abstract = "Prosodic research on child-directed speech (CDS) usually focuses on measurements of F0 mean and standard deviation (SD). In general, there is an agreement that CDS has higher pitch mean and variability than ADS (adult-directed speech). However, earlier studies have reported conflicting findings on how F0 of CDS changes with the recipient child{\textquoteright}s age, as there is evidence for both presence and absence of age-related change of pitch variability. One possibility is that the disagreement might originate from the variability of speech behaviors of speakers in different languages and cultures. Alternatively, it could be explained by the F0 measurement methodology as well. In this work, we investigate how the way we measure F0 influences the overall results on CDS change with child age. We investigated two different factors which could influence melodic analysis of speech: a) what sound segments are used to measure F0: vowels, sonorants, voiced obstruents, no account for sound segments; and b) whether the number of words within an utterance is taken into account in the analysis. We used a dataset of maternal utterances from the Providence Corpus (a collection of twice-monthly recordings of hour-long mother-child spontaneous interactions from six NA-English-speaking children) addressed at children in the age range of 1;0 to 3;0. The F0 values were calculated using OpenSMILE toolkit. The transcription-to-speech alignment was performed using WebMAUS online toolkit. The age-dependency of F0 feature was tested by means of the Spearman{\textquoteright}s rank correlation coefficient between quantized child age and the feature values associated with the age bin. The results show that the estimation procedure can affect the findings, potentially affecting developmental interpretations. In case of calculating F0 on either voiced consonants and vowels, or vowels only, there is a significant age-dependent increase of F0 SD. This is in contrast to the case of using all F0 values calculated within an utterance by F0 detection algorithm, when no significant age-dependency for F0 SD is found. Thus, it matters whether we take into account segments that are known to have proper voicing or measure F0 from all speech that an automatic F0 estimator considers as voiced irrespectively of the underlying segments. Second, we found no age-related dependencies of F0 SD (whether we took sound segment identities into account or not) for the scenario where the analysis was controlled for the number of words within an utterance, i.e. comparing one-word utterances across all ages, two-word utterances across all ages, etc. The revealed age-dependency of F0 SD for the first scenario might be explained constantly increasing length of utterances in CDS in terms of number of pronounced words along with a child age. This is since the number of pronounced words in an utterance might influence melodic variability within the utterance, where more complex intonational structure may be required to prosodically structure the longer utterances.",

The research is planned to span over a four year period, during which a corpus (dataset) of emotional Finnish speech will be collected, analyzed, and processed for modelling purposes. Based on this data, a speech emotion classifier for conversational Finnish will be developed and later further improved to enable the study and automatic recognition of idiolectical variation of affect expression.

It optimizes the desired properties of a tracking system: handling a time-varying number of sources and ordering localization estimates according to their trajectories, minimizing identity switches (IDSs).

abstract  = "Modelling of early language acquisition aims to understand how infants bootstrap their language skills. The modelling encompasses properties of the input data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their algorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to compare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more naturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates development of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step towards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of speech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major drawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is currently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling experiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for the case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) analysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of utterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in English and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an in-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data. Finally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change the conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning model. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality naturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS in terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments. We also found that an automatic sound quality assessment tool can be used to screen out useful parts of long-form recordings for a closer analysis with comparable results to that of manual quality annotation.",

abstract  = "Computational models of child language development can help us understand the cognitive underpinnings of the language learning process, which occurs along several linguistic levels at once (e.g., prosodic and phonological). However, in light of the replication crisis, modelers face the challenge of selecting representative and consolidated infant data. Thus, it is desirable to have evaluation methodologies that could account for robust empirical reference data, across multiple infant capabilities. Moreover, there is a need for practices that can compare developmental trajectories of infants to those of models as a function of language experience and development. The present study aims to take concrete steps to address these needs by introducing the concept of comparing models with large-scale cumulative empirical data from infants, as quantified by meta-analyses conducted across a large number of individual behavioral studies. We formalize the connection between measurable model and human behavior, and then present a conceptual framework for meta-analytic evaluation of computational models. We exemplify the meta-analytic model evaluation approach with two modeling experiments on infant-directed speech preference and native/non-native vowel discrimination.",

abstract  = "When assessing children in laboratory experiments, the measured responses also contain task-irrelevant participant-level variability (“noise”) and measurement noise. Since experimental data are used to make inferences of development of cognitive capabilities with age, it is important to know if reliability of the used measurements depends on child age. Any systematic age-dependent changes in reliability could result in misleading developmental trajectories, as lower reliability will necessarily result in smaller effect sizes. This paper examines age-dependency of task-independent measurement variability in early childhood (3–40 months) by analyzing two large-scale datasets of participant-level experimental responses: the ManyBabies infant-directed speech preference (MB-IDS) dataset and a saccadic reaction time (SRT) dataset collected from rural South Africa. Analysis of participant- and study-level data reveals that MB-IDS shows comparable reliability across the included age range. In contrast, SRTs reflect systematically increasing measurement consistency with increasing age. Potential reasons and implications of this divergence are briefly discussed.",

abstract  = "Background: Early neurodevelopmental care and research are in urgent need of practical methods for quantitative assessment of early motor development. Here, performance of a wearable system in early motor assessment was validated and compared to developmental tracking of physical growth charts. Methods: Altogether 1358 h of spontaneous movement during 226 recording sessions in 116 infants (age 4–19 months) were analysed using a multisensor wearable system. A deep learning-based automatic pipeline quantified categories of infants' postures and movements at a time scale of seconds. Results from an archived cohort (dataset 1, N = 55 infants) recorded under partial supervision were compared to a validation cohort (dataset 2, N = 61) recorded at infants{\textquoteright} homes by the parents. Aggregated recording-level measures including developmental age prediction (DAP) were used for comparison between cohorts. The motor growth was also compared with respective DAP estimates based on physical growth data (length, weight, and head circumference) obtained from a large cohort (N = 17,838 infants; age 4–18 months). Findings: Age-specific distributions of posture and movement categories were highly similar between infant cohorts. The DAP scores correlated tightly with age, explaining 97–99\% (94–99\% CI 95) of the variance at the group average level, and 80–82\% (72–88\%) of the variance in the individual recordings. Both the average motor and the physical growth measures showed a very strong fit to their respective developmental models (R2 = 0.99). However, single measurements showed more modality-dependent variation that was lowest for motor (σ = 1.4 [1.3–1.5 CI 95] months), length (σ = 1.5 months), and combined physical (σ = 1.5 months) measurements, and it was clearly higher for the weight (σ = 1.9 months) and head circumference (σ = 1.9 months) measurements. Longitudinal tracking showed clear individual trajectories, and its accuracy was comparable between motor and physical measures with longer measurement intervals. Interpretation: A quantified, transparent and explainable assessment of infants' motor performance is possible with a fully automated analysis pipeline, and the results replicate across independent cohorts from out-of-hospital recordings. A holistic assessment of motor development provides an accuracy that is comparable with the conventional physical growth measures. A quantitative measure of infants{\textquoteright} motor development may directly support individual diagnostics and care, as well as facilitate clinical research as an outcome measure in early intervention trials.

abstract  = "Infant motility assessment using intelligent wearables is a promising new approach for assessment of infant neurophysiological development, and where efficient signal analysis plays a central role. This study investigates the use of different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant motility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and computational burden of alternative sensor encoder and time series modeling modules and their combinations. In addition, we explore the benefits of data augmentation methods in ideal and nonideal recording conditions. The experiments are conducted using a dataset of multisensor movement recordings from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the best performance was obtained with parallel two-dimensional convolutions for intrasensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier performance. Comparison of time series models revealed that feedforward dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall, the results provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural network training for multichannel movement sensor data.",

title     = "Development of a speech emotion recognizer for large-scale child-centered audio recordings from a hospital environment",
abstract  = "In order to study how early emotional experiences shape infant development, one approach is to analyze the emotional content of speech heard by infants, as captured by child-centered daylong recordings, and as analyzed by automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) systems. However, since large-scale daylong audio is initially unannotated and differs from typical speech corpora from controlled environments, there are no existing in-domain SER systems for the task. Based on existing literature, it is also unclear what is the best approach to deploy a SER system for a new domain. Consequently, in this study, we investigated alternative strategies for deploying a SER system for large-scale child-centered audio recordings from a neonatal hospital environment, comparing cross-corpus generalization, active learning (AL), and domain adaptation (DA) methods in the process. We first conducted simulations with existing emotion-labeled speech corpora to find the best strategy for SER system deployment. We then tested how the findings generalize to our new initially unannotated dataset. As a result, we found that the studied AL method provided overall the most consistent results, being less dependent on the specifics of the training corpora or speech features compared to the alternative methods. However, in situations without the possibility to annotate data, unsupervised DA proved to be the best approach. We also observed that deployment of a SER system for real-world daylong child-centered audio recordings achieved a SER performance level comparable to those reported in literature, and that the amount of human effort required for the system deployment was overall relatively modest.",

abstract  = "Audio question answering (AQA) is the task of producing natural language answers when a system is provided with audio and natural language questions. In this paper, we propose neural network architectures based on self-attention and cross-attention for the AQA task. The self-attention layers extract powerful audio and textual representations. The cross-attention maps audio features that are relevant to the textual features to produce answers. All our models are trained on the recently proposed Clotho-AQA dataset for both binary yes/no questions and single-word answer questions. Our results clearly show improvement over the reference method reported in the original paper. On the yes/no binary classification task, our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 68.3\% compared to 62.7\% in the reference model. For the single-word answers multiclass classifier, our model produces a top-1 and top-5 accuracy of 57.9\% and 99.8\% compared to 54.2\% and 93.7\% in the reference model respectively. We further discuss some of the challenges in the Clotho-AQA dataset such as the presence of the same answer word in multiple tenses, singular and plural forms, and the presence of specific and generic answers to the same question. We address these issues and present a revised version of the dataset.",

title     = "Automatic Assessment of Parkinson's Disease Using Speech Representations of Phonation and Articulation",
abstract  = "Speech from people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are likely to be degraded on phonation, articulation, and prosody. Motivated to describe articulation deficits comprehensively, we investigated 1) the universal phonological features that model articulation manner and place, also known as speech attributes, and 2) glottal features capturing phonation characteristics. These were further supplemented by, and compared with, prosodic features using a popular compact feature set and standard MFCC. Temporal characteristics of these features were modeled by convolutional neural networks. Besides the features, we were also interested in the speech tasks for collecting data for automatic PD speech assessment, like sustained vowels, text reading, and spontaneous monologue. For this, we utilized a recently collected Finnish PD corpus (PDSTU) as well as a Spanish database (PC-GITA). The experiments were formulated as regression problems against expert ratings of PD-related symptoms, including ratings of speech intelligibility, voice impairment, overall severity of communication disorder on PDSTU, as well as on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) on PC-GITA. The experimental results show: 1) the speech attribute features can well indicate the severity of pathologies in parkinsonian speech; 2) combining phonation features with articulatory features improves the PD assessment performance, but requires high-quality recordings to be applicable; 3) read speech leads to more accurate automatic ratings than the use of sustained vowels, but not if the amount of speech is limited to correspond to the sustained vowels in duration; and 4) jointly using data from several speech tasks can further improve the automatic PD assessment performance.",

In order to fully realize the potential of these approaches and further our understanding of how infants learn language, simulations must closely emulate real-life situations by training on developmentally plausible corpora and benchmarking against appropriate test sets. To this end, we propose a language-acquisition-friendly benchmark to probe spoken language models at the lexical and syntactic levels, both of which are compatible with the vocabulary typical of children's language experiences. This paper introduces the benchmark and summarizes a range of experiments showing its usefulness.

title     = "Computational Insights to Acquisition of Phonemes, Words, and Word Meanings in Early Language: Sequential or Parallel Acquisition?",
abstract  = "Previous computational models of early language acquisition have shown how linguistic structure of speech can be acquired using auditory or audiovisual learning mechanisms. However, real infants have sustained access to both uni- and multimodal sensory experiences. Therefore, it is of interest how the uni- and multimodal learning mechanisms could operate in concert, and how their interplay might affect the acquisition dynamics of different linguistic representations. This paper explores these questions with a computational model capable of simultaneous auditory and audiovisual learning from speech and images. We study how the model{\textquoteright}s latent representations reflect phonemic, lexical, and semantic knowledge as a function of language experience. We also test how the findings vary with differential emphasis on the two learning mechanisms. As a result, we find phonemic learning always starting to emerge before lexical learning, followed by semantics. However, there is also notable overlap in their development. The same pattern emerges irrespectively of the emphasis on auditory or audiovisual learning. The result illustrates how the acquisition dynamics of linguistic representations are decoupled from the primary learning objectives (mechanisms) of the learner, and how the emergence of phonemes and words can be facilitated by both auditory and audiovisual learning in a synergetic manner.",

This challenge motivates us to address the new problem of few-shot class-incremental audio classification. This study aims to enable a model to continuously recognize new classes of sounds with a few training samples of new classes while remembering the learned ones. To this end, we propose a method to generate discriminative prototypes and use them to expand the model's classifier for recognizing sounds of new and learned classes. The model is first trained with a random episodic training strategy, and then its backbone is used to generate the prototypes. A dynamic relation projection module refines the prototypes to enhance their discriminability. Results on two datasets (derived from the corpora of Nsynth and FSD-MIX-CLIPS) show that the proposed method exceeds three state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy and performance dropping rate.",

With a constant training setting on the retrieval system from [1], we study eight sampling strategies, including hard and semi-hard negative sampling. Experimental results show that retrieval performance varies dramatically among different strategies. Particularly, by selecting semi-hard negatives with cross-modality scores, the retrieval system gains improved performance in both text-to-audio and audio-to-text retrieval. Besides, we show that feature collapse occurs while sampling hard negatives with cross-modality scores.",

abstract  = "Privacy preservation has long been a concern in smart acoustic monitoring systems, where speech can be passively recorded along with a target signal in the system's operating environment. In this study, we propose the integration of two commonly used approaches in privacy preservation: source separation and adversarial representation learning. The proposed system learns the latent representation of audio recordings such that it prevents differentiating between speech and non-speech recordings. Initially, the source separation network filters out some of the privacy-sensitive data, and during the adversarial learning process, the system will learn privacy-preserving representation on the filtered signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing our method against systems without source separation, without adversarial learning, and without both. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed system can significantly improve speech privacy preservation compared to that of using source separation or adversarial learning solely while maintaining good performance in the acoustic monitoring task.",

abstract  = "Speech representation learning with self-supervised algorithms has resulted in notable performance boosts in many downstream tasks. Recent work combined self-supervised learning (SSL) and visually grounded speech (VGS) processing mechanisms for representation learning. The joint training with SSL and VGS mechanisms provides the opportunity to utilize both unlabeled speech and speech-related visual information based on data availability. This has shown to enhance the quality of learned representations, especially at encoding semantic- and lexical-level knowledge. In this work, we further study the joint optimization of wav2vec 2.0-based SSL and transformer-based VGS as a multitask learning system. We explore a set of training scenarios to understand how speech representations are shared or transferred between the two tasks, and what is the optimal training strategy for cross-modal semantic retrieval and phoneme discrimination performance. As a result, we find that sequential training with wav2vec 2.0 first and VGS next provides higher performance on audio-visual retrieval compared to simultaneous optimization of both learning mechanisms. However, the parallel SSL-VGS training reduces the effects of catastrophic forgetting when switching between optimization criteria. Moreover, the results suggest that phonemic representations learned through the VGS mechanism may generalize better across datasets compared to those learned with SSL.",

abstract  = "Audio source separation is often achieved by estimating the magnitude spectrogram of each source, and then applying a phase recovery (or spectrogram inversion) algorithm to retrieve time-domain signals. Typically, spectrogram inversion is treated as an optimization problem involving one or several terms in order to promote estimates that comply with a consistency property, a mixing constraint, and/or a target magnitude objective. Nonetheless, it is still unclear which set of constraints and problem formulation is the most appropriate in practice. In this paper, we design a general framework for deriving spectrogram inversion algorithm, which is based on formulating optimization problems by combining these objectives either as soft penalties or hard constraints. We solve these by means of algorithms that perform alternating projections on the subsets corresponding to each objective/constraint. Our framework encompasses existing techniques from the literature as well as novel algorithms. We investigate the potential of these approaches for a speech enhancement task. In particular, one of our novel algorithms outperforms other approaches in a realistic setting where the magnitudes are estimated beforehand using a neural network.",

In this work, we present a method for self-supervised representation learning based on audio-visual spatial alignment (AVSA), a more sophisticated alignment task than the audio-visual correspondence (AVC). In addition to the correspondence, AVSA also learns from the spatial location of acoustic and visual content. Based on 360° video and Ambisonics audio, we propose selection of visual objects using object detection, and beamforming of the audio signal towards the detected objects, attempting to learn the spatial alignment between objects and the sound they produce. We investigate the use of spatial audio features to represent the audio input, and different audio formats: Ambisonics, mono, and stereo. Experimental results show a 10\% improvement on AVSA for the first order ambisonics intensity vector (FOA-IV) in comparison with log-mel spectrogram features; the addition of object-oriented crops also brings significant performance increases for the human action recognition downstream task. A number of audio-only downstream tasks are devised for testing the effectiveness of the learnt audio feature representation, obtaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on acoustic scene classification from ambisonic and binaural audio.",

abstract  = "We investigate unsupervised learning of correspondences between sound events and textual phrases through aligning audio clips with textual captions describing the content of a whole audio clip. We align originally unaligned and unannotated audio clips and their captions by scoring the similarities between audio frames and words, as encoded by modality-specific encoders and using a ranking-loss criterion to optimize the model. After training, we obtain clip-caption similarity by averaging frame-word similarities and estimate event-phrase correspondences by calculating frame-phrase similarities. We evaluate the method with two cross-modal tasks: audio-caption retrieval, and phrase-based sound event detection (SED). Experimental results show that the proposed method can globally associate audio clips with captions as well as locally learn correspondences between individual sound events and textual phrases in an unsupervised manner.",

abstract  = "Automatic estimation of domestic activities from audio can be used to solve many problems, such as reducing the labor cost for nursing the elderly people. This study focuses on solving the problem of domestic activity clustering from audio. The target of domestic activity clustering is to cluster audio clips which belong to the same category of domestic activity into one cluster in an unsupervised way. In this paper, we propose a method of domestic activity clustering using a depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder network. In the proposed method, initial embeddings are learned by the depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder, and a clustering-oriented loss is designed to jointly optimize embedding refinement and cluster assignment. Different methods are evaluated on a public dataset (a derivative of the SINS dataset) used in the challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) in 2018. Our method obtains the normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 54.46\%, and the clustering accuracy (CA) score of 63.64\%, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of NMI and CA. In addition, both computational complexity and memory requirement of our method is lower than that of previous deep-model-based methods.

The proposed method first separates the observed array mixture signal into single speaker array signals using deep clustering (DC), which is a deep neural network (DNN) based method that maps source signal information into an embedding space, in which a clustering algorithm can be then used to separate the sources. Spatial information in terms of time difference of arrival (TDoA) can be then extracted from each separated signal. This approach is novel for TDoA estimation of multiple sources, since the state-of-the-art method first localizes multiple sources and then performs the separation. The inherent advantage of the proposed approach is that there is no need for data association of the measurements and the sources. The results with data from an actual room show that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the- art in extracting the spatial information from two concurrent speakers mixture signal.",

title    = "Can phones, syllables, and words emerge as side-products of cross-situational audiovisual learning? - A computational investigation",
abstract = "Decades of research has studied how language learning infants learn to discriminate speech sounds, segment words, and associate words with their meanings. While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the exact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet remains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic comprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech and concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate without prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units, and without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has raised the question whether knowledge of linguistic units, such as phone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent representations supporting the translation between speech and representations in other modalities, and instead of the units ever being proximal learning goals for the learner. In this study, formulate this idea as the so-called latent language hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review the extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing computational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning simulations with different neural network models for audiovisual cross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real speech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the networks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by utilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic selectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations. As a result, we find that representations associated with phonetic, syllabic, and lexical units of speech indeed emerge from the audiovisual learning process. The finding is also robust against variations in model architecture or characteristics of model training and testing data. The results suggest that cross-modal and cross-situational learning may, in principle, assist in early language development much beyond just enabling association of acoustic word forms to their referential meanings.",

title     = "Joint speaker separation and recognition using non-negative matrix deconvolution with adaptive dictionary",
abstract  = "In this article, we propose a new method for joint cochannel speaker separation and recognition called adaptive-dictionary non-negative matrix deconvolution (DANMD). This method is an extension of non-negative matrix deconvolution (NMD) which models spectrogram matrix as a linear combination of dictionary elements (atoms). We propose a dictionary which is a linear combination of speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability. The dictionary is parametric and all atoms depend on a small number of parameters. The speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability are learned from recordings of tens or hundreds of speakers. We show that the proposed method can be applied to the single-channel speech separation task where two speakers of unknown identity are to be separated. In a scenario where the unknown speakers{\textquoteright} recordings are in training dataset together with recordings of many other speakers, we show that the proposed method outperforms stacked NMD (NMD with a dictionary which contains atoms of all speakers in the dataset) in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). DANMD was also tested in a scenario where recordings of the recognized speakers were not in the training dataset. In this case it brought clearly positive signal-to-distortion ratios. The proposed model was also tested for a co-channel speaker identification task, where the parameters of the adapted model are a basis for a decision about the identity of the speakers in the mixture. In this case, the accuracy was 81.2 in comparison to 84.1 in the case of stacked NMD. While the speaker recognition accuracy is lower for the new approach, we find the primary value in the improved SDR.",

title     = "Towards Sonification in Multimodal and User-friendly Explainable Artificial Intelligence",
abstract  = "We are largely used to hearing explanations. For example, if someone thinks you are sad today, they might reply to your {"}why?{"}with {"}because you were so Hmmmmm-mmm-mmm{"}. Today's Artificial Intelligence (AI), however, is - if at all - largely providing explanations of decisions in a visual or textual manner. While such approaches are good for communication via visual media such as in research papers or screens of intelligent devices, they may not always be the best way to explain; especially when the end user is not an expert. In particular, when the AI's task is about Audio Intelligence, visual explanations appear less intuitive than audible, sonified ones. Sonification has also great potential for explainable AI (XAI) in systems that deal with non-audio data - for example, because it does not require visual contact or active attention of a user. Hence, sonified explanations of AI decisions face a challenging, yet highly promising and pioneering task. That involves incorporating innovative XAI algorithms to allow pointing back at the learning data responsible for decisions made by an AI, and to include decomposition of the data to identify salient aspects. It further aims to identify the components of the preprocessing, feature representation, and learnt attention patterns that are responsible for the decisions. Finally, it targets decision-making at the model-level, to provide a holistic explanation of the chain of processing in typical pattern recognition problems from end-to-end. Sonified AI explanations will need to unite methods for sonification of the identified aspects that benefit decisions, decomposition and recomposition of audio to sonify which parts in the audio were responsible for the decision, and rendering attention patterns and salient feature representations audible. Benchmarking sonified XAI is challenging, as it will require a comparison against a backdrop of existing, state-of-the-art visual and textual alternatives, as well as synergistic complementation of all modalities in user evaluations. Sonified AI explanations will need to target different user groups to allow personalisation of the sonification experience for different user needs, to lead to a major breakthrough in comprehensibility of AI via hearing how decisions are made, hence supporting tomorrow's humane AI's trustability. Here, we introduce and motivate the general idea, and provide accompanying considerations including milestones of realisation of sonifed XAI and foreseeable risks.",

abstract  = "The paper addresses acoustic vehicle speed estimation using single sensor measurements. We introduce a new speed-dependent feature based on the attenuation of the sound amplitude. The feature is predicted from the audio signal and used as input to a regression model for speed estimation. For this research, we have collected, annotated, and published a dataset of audio-video recordings of single vehicles passing by the camera at a known constant speed. The dataset contains 304 urban-environment real-field recordings of ten different vehicles. The proposed method is trained and tested on the collected dataset. Experiments show that it is able to accurately predict the pass-by instant of a vehicle and to estimate its speed with an average error of 7.39 km/h. When the speed is discretized into intervals of 10 km/h, the proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 53.2\% for correct interval prediction and 93.4\% when misclassification of one interval is allowed. Experiments also show that sound disturbances, such as wind, severely affect acoustic speed estimation.",

abstract  = "Recordings captured by wearable microphones are a standard method for investigating young children{\textquoteright}s language environments. A key measure to quantify from such data is the amount of speech present in children{\textquoteright}s home environments. To this end, the LENA recorder and software—a popular system for measuring linguistic input—estimates the number of adult words that children may hear over the course of a recording. However, word count estimation is challenging to do in a language- independent manner; the relationship between observable acoustic patterns and language-specific lexical entities is far from uniform across human languages. In this paper, we ask whether some alternative linguistic units, namely phone(me)s or syllables, could be measured instead of, or in parallel with, words in order to achieve improved cross-linguistic applicability and comparability of an automated system for measuring child language input. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of measuring different units from theoretical and technical points of view. We also investigate the practical applicability of measuring such units using a novel system called Automatic LInguistic unit Count Estimator (ALICE) together with audio from seven child-centered daylong audio corpora from diverse cultural and linguistic environments. We show that language-independent measurement of phoneme counts is somewhat more accurate than syllables or words, but all three are highly correlated with human annotations on the same data. We share an open-source implementation of ALICE for use by the language research community, enabling automatic phoneme, syllable, and word count estimation from child-centered audio recordings.",

abstract  = "In the previous decade, dozens of studies involving thousands of children across several research disciplines have made use of a combined daylong audio-recorder and automated algorithmic analysis called the LENAⓇ system, which aims to assess children{\textquoteright}s language environment. While the system{\textquoteright}s prevalence in the language acquisition domain is steadily growing, there are only scattered validation efforts on only some of its key characteristics. Here, we assess the LENAⓇ system{\textquoteright}s accuracy across all of its key measures: speaker classification, Child Vocalization Counts (CVC), Conversational Turn Counts (CTC), and Adult Word Counts (AWC). Our assessment is based on manual annotation of clips that have been randomly or periodically sampled out of daylong recordings, collected from (a) populations similar to the system{\textquoteright}s original training data (North American English-learning children aged 3-36 months), (b) children learning another dialect of English (UK), and (c) slightly older children growing up in a different linguistic and socio-cultural setting (Tsimane{\textquoteright} learners in rural Bolivia). We find reasonably high accuracy in some measures (AWC, CVC), with more problematic levels of performance in others (CTC, precision of male adults and other children). Statistical analyses do not support the view that performance is worse for children who are dissimilar from the LENAⓇ original training set. Whether LENAⓇ results are accurate enough for a given research, educational, or clinical application depends largely on the specifics at hand. We therefore conclude with a set of recommendations to help researchers make this determination for their goals.",

abstract  = "Researchers have recently started to study how the emotional speech heard by young infants can affect their developmental outcomes. As a part of this research, hundreds of hours of daylong recordings from preterm infants' audio environments were collected from two hospitals in Finland and Estonia in the context of so-called APPLE study. In order to analyze the emotional content of speech in such a massive dataset, an automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) system is required. However, there are no emotion labels or existing indomain SER systems to be used for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce this initially unannotated large-scale real-world audio dataset and describe the development of a functional SER system for the Finnish subset of the data. We explore the effectiveness of alternative state-of-the-art techniques to deploy a SER system to a new domain, comparing cross-corpus generalization, WGAN-based domain adaptation, and active learning in the task. As a result, we show that the best-performing models are able to achieve a classification performance of 73.4\% unweighted average recall (UAR) and 73.2\% UAR for a binary classification for valence and arousal, respectively. The results also show that active learning achieves the most consistent performance compared to the two alternatives.",

Regression-based approaches have certain advantages over classification-based, such as continuous direction-of-arrival estimation of static and moving sources. However, multi-source scenarios require multiple regressors without a clear training strategy up-to-date, that does not rely on auxiliary information such as simultaneous sound classification. We investigate end-to-end training of such methods with a technique recently proposed for video object detectors, adapted to the SSL setting. A differentiable network is constructed that can be plugged to the output of the localizer to solve the optimal assignment between predictions and references, optimizing directly the popular CLEAR-MOT tracking metrics. Results indicate large improvements over directly optimizing mean squared errors, in terms of localization error, detection metrics, and tracking capabilities.",

We test our model and a previously proposed model in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the se- mantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models.

abstract  = "Imprecise vowel articulation can be observed in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Acoustic features measuring vowel articulation have been demonstrated to be effective indicators of PD in its assessment. Standard clinical vowel articulation features of vowel working space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formants centralization ratio (FCR), are derived the first two formants of the three corner vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/. Conventionally, manual annotation of the corner vowels from speech data is required before measuring vowel articulation. This process is time-consuming. The present work aims to reduce human effort in clinical analysis of PD speech by proposing an automatic pipeline for vowel articulation assessment. The method is based on automatic corner vowel detection using a language universal phoneme recognizer, followed by statistical analysis of the formant data. The approach removes the restrictions of prior knowledge of speaking content and the language in question. Experimental results on a Finnish PD speech corpus demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed automatic method in deriving VAI, VSA, FCR and F2i/F2u (the second formant ratio for vowels /i/ and /u/). The automatically computed parameters are shown to be highly correlated with features computed with manual annotations of corner vowels. In addition, automatically and manually computed vowel articulation features have comparable correlations with experts' ratings on speech intelligibility, voice impairment and overall severity of communication disorder. Language-independence of the proposed approach is further validated on a Spanish PD database, PC-GITA, as well as on TORGO corpus of English dysarthric speech. ",

In this work we propose a method for learning audio representations using an audio autoencoder (AAE), a general word embed-dings model (WEM), and a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism. MHA attends on the output of the WEM, pro-viding a contextualized representation of the tags associated with the audio, and we align the output of MHA with the out-put of the encoder of AAE using a contrastive loss. We jointly optimize AAE and MHA and we evaluate the audio representations (i.e. the output of the encoder of AAE) by utilizing them in three different downstream tasks, namely sound, music genre, and music instrument classification. Our results show that employing multi-head self-attention with multiple heads in the tag-based network can induce better learned audio representations.",

In this paper we propose a method that employs a non-uniform fixed-point quantization and a virtual bit shift (VBS) to improve the accuracy of the quantization of the DNN weights. We evaluate our method in a speech enhancement application, where a fully connected DNN is used to predict the clean speech spectrum from the input noisy speech spectrum. A DNN is optimized, its memory requirement is calculated, and its performance is evaluated using the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric. The application of the low-bit quantization leads to a 50\% reduction of the DNN memory requirement while the STOI performance drops only by 2.7\%.",

For example, an automatic audio focus for video capture on a mobile phone requires robust detection of relevant acoustic events around the device and their direction. Existing SELD approaches have been evaluated using material produced in controlled indoor environments, or the audio is simulated by mixing isolated sounds to different spatial locations. This paper studies SELD of speech in diverse everyday environments, where the audio corresponds to typical usage scenarios of handheld mobile devices. In order to allow weighting the relative importance of localization vs. detection, we will propose a two-stage hierarchical system, where the first stage is to detect the target events, and the second stage is to localize them. The proposed method utilizes convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and is evaluated on a database of manually annotated microphone array recordings from various acoustic conditions. The array is embedded in a contemporary mobile phone form factor. The obtained results show good speech detection and localization accuracy of the proposed method in contrast to a non-hierarchical flat classification model.",

title     = "Neural network-based acoustic vehicle counting",
abstract  = "This paper addresses acoustic vehicle counting using one-channel audio. We predict the pass-by instants of vehicles from local minima of clipped vehicle-to-microphone distance. This distance is predicted from audio using a two-stage (coarse-fine) regression, with both stages realised via neural networks (NNs). Experiments show that the NN-based distance regression outperforms by far the previously proposed support vector regression. The 95\% confidence interval for the mean of vehicle counting error is within [0.28\%, −0.55\%]. Besides the minima-based counting, we propose a deep learning counting that operates on the predicted distance without detecting local minima. Although outperformed in accuracy by the former approach, deep counting has a significant advantage in that it does not depend on minima detection parameters. Results also show that removing low frequencies in features improves the counting performance.",

title     = "Online Own Voice Detection for a Multi-channel Multi-sensor In-Ear Device",
abstract  = "Voice activity detection (VAD) aims for detecting the presence of speech in a given input signal, and is often the first step in voice -based applications such as speech communication systems. In the context of personal devices, own voice detection (OVD) is a sub-task of VAD, since it targets speech detection of the person wearing the device, while ignoring other speakers in the presence of interference signals. This article first summarizes recent single and multi-microphone, multi-sensor, and hearing aids related VAD techniques. Then, a wearable in-ear device equipped with multiple microphones and an accelerometer is investigated for the OVD task using a neural network with input embedding and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. The device picks up the user{\textquoteright}s speech signal through air as well as vibrations through the body. However, besides external sounds the device is sensitive to user{\textquoteright}s own non-speech vocal noises (e.g. coughing, yawning, etc.) and movement noise caused by physical activities. A signal mixing model is proposed to produce databases of noisy observations used for training and testing the frame-by-frame OVD method. The best model{\textquoteright}s performance is further studied in the presence of different recorded interference. An ablation study reports the model{\textquoteright}s performance on sub-sets of sensors. The results show that the OVD approach is robust towards both user motion and user generated vocal non-speech sounds in the presence of loud external interference. The approach is suitable for real-time operation and achieves 90-96 \% OVD accuracy in challenging use scenarios with a short 10 ms processing frame length.",

abstract  = "Sound event localization and detection is a novel area of research that emerged from the combined interest of analyzing the acoustic scene in terms of the spatial and temporal activity of sounds of interest. This paper presents an overview of the first international evaluation on sound event localization and detection, organized as a task of the DCASE 2019 Challenge. A large-scale realistic dataset of spatialized sound events was generated for the challenge, to be used for training of learning-based approaches, and for evaluation of the submissions in an unlabeled subset. The overview presents in detail how the systems were evaluated and ranked and the characteristics of the best-performing systems. Common strategies in terms of input features, model architectures, training approaches, exploitation of prior knowledge, and data augmentation are discussed. Since ranking in the challenge was based on individually evaluating localization and event classification performance, part of the overview focuses on presenting metrics for the joint measurement of the two, together with a reevaluation of submissions using these new metrics. The new analysis reveals submissions that performed better on the joint task of detecting the correct type of event close to its original location than some of the submissions that were ranked higher in the challenge. Consequently, ranking of submissions which performed strongly when evaluated separately on detection or localization, but not jointly on both, was affected negatively.",

abstract  = "Advancements in deep learning have resulted in new techniques to address sophisticated audio processing tasks, such as sound localization and recognition. However, supervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires a significant amount of training data. Existing datasets are either recorded or allow synthetic recordings through impulse responses (IRs) via convolution. Recorded datasets often lack sufficient and versatile material for supervised DNN training. On the other hand, impulse response databases allow large scale dataset creation, provided that suitable IRs are available. However, existing IR datasets do not cater to the data requirements of moving and crossing sources problem in sound localization, due to insufficient angular resolution. This work introduces a versatile room IR dataset to address this problem. Various diverse environments such as office rooms, meeting rooms, corridor, and an anechoic chamber are chosen for the data collection. The chosen rooms have varying characteristics, such as reverberation times (T60) and volumes. The data is collected by placing the speaker at three different distances from a rotated microphone array, thus mimicking the moving source condition. Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is performed by spatializing the sound signal with the collected IRs to verify their quality. The dataset will be publicly available.",

Our goal is to obtain a classifier that is capable of recognizing audio instances of sound classes that have no available training samples, but only semantic side information. We employ a bilinear compatibility framework to learn an acoustic-semantic projection between intermediate-level representations of audio instances and sound classes, i.e., acoustic embeddings and semantic embeddings. We use VGGish to extract deep acoustic embeddings from audio clips, and pre-trained language models (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to generate either label embeddings from textual labels or sentence embeddings from sentence descriptions of sound classes. Audio classification is performed by a linear compatibility function that measures how compatible an acoustic embedding and a semantic embedding are. We evaluate the proposed method on a small balanced dataset ESC-50 and a large-scale unbalanced audio subset of AudioSet. The experimental results show that classification performance is significantly improved by involving sound classes that are semantically close to the test classes in training. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that both label embeddings and sentence embeddings are useful for zero-shot learning. Classification performance is improved by concatenating label/sentence embeddings generated with different language models. With their hybrid concatenations, the results are improved further.",

abstract  = "The spatial information about a sound source is carried by acoustic waves to a microphone array and can be observed through estimation of phase and amplitude differences between microphones. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) captures the propagation delay of the wavefront between microphones and can be used to steer a beamformer or to localize the source. However, reverberation and interference can deteriorate the TDoA estimate. Deep neural networks (DNNs) through supervised learning can extract speech related TDoAs in more adverse conditions than traditional correlation -based methods. Acoustic simulations provide large amounts of data with annotations, while real recordings require manual annotations or the use of reference sensors with proper calibration procedures. The distributions of these two data sources can differ. When a DNN model that is trained using simulated data is presented with real data from a different distribution, its performance decreases if not properly addressed. For the reduction of DNN –based TDoA estimation error, this work investigates the role of different input normalization techniques, mixing of simulated and real data for training, and applying an adversarial domain adaptation technique. Results quantify the reduction in TDoA error for real data using the different approaches. It is evident that the use of normalization methods, domain-adaptation, and real data during training can reduce the TDoA error.",

abstract  = "Infants' spontaneous and voluntary movements mirror developmental integrity of brain networks since they require coordinated activation of multiple sites in the central nervous system. Accordingly, early detection of infants with atypical motor development holds promise for recognizing those infants who are at risk for a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders). Previously, novel wearable technology has shown promise for offering efficient, scalable and automated methods for movement assessment in adults. Here, we describe the development of an infant wearable, a multi-sensor smart jumpsuit that allows mobile accelerometer and gyroscope data collection during movements. Using this suit, we first recorded play sessions of 22 typically developing infants of approximately 7 months of age. These data were manually annotated for infant posture and movement based on video recordings of the sessions, and using a novel annotation scheme specifically designed to assess the overall movement pattern of infants in the given age group. A machine learning algorithm, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was then trained for automatic detection of posture and movement classes using the data and annotations. Our experiments show that the setup can be used for quantitative tracking of infant movement activities with a human equivalent accuracy, i.e., it meets the human inter-rater agreement levels in infant posture and movement classification. We also quantify the ambiguity of human observers in analyzing infant movements, and propose a method for utilizing this uncertainty for performance improvements in training of the automated classifier. Comparison of different sensor configurations also shows that four-limb recording leads to the best performance in posture and movement classification.",

The proposed system analyzes an initially unlabeled audio dataset, from which it selects sound segments for manual annotation. The candidate segments are generated based on a proposed change point detection approach, and the selection is based on the principle of mismatch-first farthest-traversal. During the training of SED models, recordings are used as training inputs, preserving the long-term context for annotated segments. The proposed system clearly outperforms reference methods in the two datasets used for evaluation (TUT Rare Sound 2017 and TAU Spatial Sound 2019). Training with recordings as context outperforms training with only annotated segments. Mismatch-first farthest-traversal outperforms reference sample selection methods based on random sampling and uncertainty sampling. Remarkably, the required annotation effort can be greatly reduced on the dataset where target sound events are rare: by annotating only 2\% of the training data, the achieved SED performance is similar to annotating all the training data.",

title     = "Analysis of Predictive Coding Models for Phonemic Representation Learning in Small Datasets",
abstract  = "Neural network models using predictive coding are interesting from the viewpoint of computational modelling of human language acquisition, where the objective is to understand how linguistic units could be learned from speech without any labels. Even though several promising predictive coding -based learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature, it is currently unclear how well they generalise to different languages and training dataset sizes. In addition, despite that such models have shown to be effective phonemic feature learners, it is unclear whether minimisation of the predictive loss functions of these models also leads to optimal phoneme-like representations. The present study investigates the behaviour of two predictive coding models, Autoregressive Predictive Coding and Contrastive Predictive Coding, in a phoneme discrimination task (ABX task) for two languages with different dataset sizes. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the autoregressive loss and the phoneme discrimination scores with the two datasets. However, to our surprise, the CPC model shows rapid convergence already after one pass over the training data, and, on average, its representations outperform those of APC on both languages. ",

abstract  = "It has been suggested that early cry parameters are connected to later cognitive abilities. The present study is the first to investigate whether the acoustic features of infant cry are associated with cognitive development already during the first year, as measured by oculomotor orienting and attention disengagement. Cry sounds for acoustic analyses (fundamental frequency; F0) were recorded in two neonatal cohorts at the age of 0–8 days (Tampere, Finland) or at 6 weeks (Cape Town, South Africa). Eye tracking was used to measure oculomotor orienting to peripheral visual stimuli and attention disengagement from central stimuli at 8 months (Tampere) or at 6 months (Cape Town) of age. Only a marginal positive correlation between fundamental frequency of cry (F0) and visual attention disengagement was observed in the Tampere cohort, but not in the Cape Town cohort. This correlation indicated that infants from the Tampere cohort with a higher neonatal F0 were marginally slower to shift their gaze away from the central stimulus to the peripheral stimulus. No associations between F0 and oculomotor orienting were observed in either cohort. We discuss possible factors influencing the current pattern of results suggesting a lack of replicable associations between neonatal cry and visual attention and suggest directions for future research investigating the potential of early cry analysis in predicting later cognitive development.",

For achieving high performance, DNNs often need a large amount of annotated data which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a method for learning audio representations, aligning the learned latent representations of audio and associated tags. Aligning is done by maximizing the agreement of the latent representations of audio and tags, using a contrastive loss. The result is an audio embedding model which reflects acoustic and semantic characteristics of sounds. We evaluate the quality of our embedding model, measuring its performance as a feature extractor on three different tasks (namely, sound event recognition, and music genre and musical instrument classification), and investigate what type of characteristics the model captures. Our results are promising, sometimes in par with the state-of-the-art in the considered tasks and the embeddings produced with our method are well correlated with some acoustic descriptors. ",

abstract  = "Recent approaches for music source separation are almost exclusively based on deep neural networks, mostly employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although RNNs are in many cases superior than other types of deep neural networks for sequence processing, they are known to have specific difficulties in training and parallelization, especially for the typically long sequences encountered in music source separation. In this paper we present a use-case of replacing RNNs with depth-wise separable (DWS) convolutions, which are a lightweight and faster variant of the typical convolutions. We focus on singing voice separation, employing an RNN architecture, and we replace the RNNs with DWS convolutions (DWS-CNNs). We conduct an ablation study and examine the effect of the number of channels and layers of DWS-CNNs on the source separation performance, by utilizing the standard metrics of signal-to-artifacts, signal-to-interference, and signal-to-distortion ratio. Our results show that by replacing RNNs with DWS-CNNs yields an improvement of 1.20, 0.06, 0.37 dB, respectively, while using only 20.57\% of the amount of parameters of the RNN architecture.",

abstract  = "Audio captioning is a multi-modal task, focusing on using natural language for describing the contents of general audio. Most audio captioning methods are based on deep neural networks, employing an encoder-decoder scheme and a dataset with audio clips and corresponding natural language descriptions (i.e. captions). A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of words in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically non-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. {"}a{"}, {"}the{"}), and other words are infrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns). In this paper we propose two methods to mitigate this class imbalance problem. First, in an autoencoder setting for audio captioning, we weigh each word's contribution to the training loss inversely proportional to its number of occurrences in the whole dataset. Secondly, in addition to multi-class, word-level audio captioning task, we define a multi-label side task based on clip-level content word detection by training a separate decoder. We use the loss from the second task to regularize the jointly trained encoder for the audio captioning task. We evaluate our method using Clotho, a recently published, wide-scale audio captioning dataset, and our results show an increase of 37\% relative improvement with SPIDEr metric over the baseline method.",

In particular, the multiple input spectrogram inversion (MISI) algorithm has been exploited successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter. First, it has originally been introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals. Experiments conducted on a speech separation task show that oMISI performs as well as its offline counterpart, thus demonstrating its potential for real-time source separation.",

V C is carried out via local minima detection in the predicted distance. We propose to set the minima detection threshold at a point where the probabilities of false positives and false negatives coincide so they statistically cancel each other in total vehicle number. The method is trained and tested on a traffic-monitoring dataset comprising 422 short, 20-second one-channel sound files with a total of 1421 vehicles passing by the microphone. Relative V C error in a traffic location not used in the training is below 2\% within a wide range of detection threshold values. Experimental results show that the regression accuracy in noisy environments is improved by introducing a novel high-frequency power feature.",

The number of the channels of the CNNs and size of the weight matrices of the RNNs have a direct effect on the total amount of parameters of the SED method, which is to a couple of millions. Additionally, the usually long sequences that are used as an input to an SED method along with the employment of an RNN, introduce implications like increased training time, difficulty at gradient flow, and impeding the parallelization of the SED method. To tackle all these problems, we propose the replacement of the CNNs with depthwise separable convolutions and the replacement of the RNNs with dilated convolutions.

Typical audio captioning methods rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), where the target of the DNN is to map the input audio sequence to an output sequence of words, i.e. the caption. Though, the length of the textual description is considerably less than the length of the audio signal, for example 10 words versus some thousands of audio feature vectors. This clearly indicates that an output word corresponds to multiple input feature vectors. In this work we present an approach that focuses on explicitly taking advantage of this difference of lengths between sequences, by applying a temporal sub-sampling to the audio input sequence. We employ a sequence-to-sequence method, which uses a fixed-length vector as an output from the encoder, and we apply temporal sub-sampling between the RNNs of the encoder. We evaluate the benefit of our approach by employing the freely available dataset Clotho and we evaluate the impact of different factors of temporal sub-sampling.

abstract  = "Unsupervised spoken term discovery (UTD) aims at finding recurring segments of speech from a corpus of acoustic speech data. One potential approach to this problem is to use dynamic time warping (DTW) to find well-aligning patterns from the speech data. However, automatic selection of initial candidate segments for the DTW-alignment and detection of “sufficiently good” alignments among those require some type of predefined criteria, often operationalized as threshold parameters for pair-wise distance metrics between signal representations. In the existing UTD systems, the optimal hyperparameters may differ across datasets, limiting their applicability to new corpora and truly low-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic approach to DTW-based UTD named as PDTW. In PDTW, distributional characteristics of the processed corpus are utilized for adaptive evaluation of alignment quality, thereby enabling systematic discovery of pattern pairs that have similarity what would be expected by coincidence. We test PDTW on Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017 datasets as a part of 2020 implementation of the challenge. The results show that the system performs consistently on all five tested languages using fixed hyperparameters, clearly outperforming the earlier DTW-based system in terms of coverage of the detected patterns.

Finally, the initial and edited captions are rated, keeping the top ones for the produced dataset. We objectively evaluate the impact of our framework during the process of creating an audio captioning dataset, in terms of diversity and amount of typographical errors in the obtained captions. The obtained results show that the resulting dataset has less typographical errors than the initial captions, and on average each sound in the produced dataset has captions with a Jaccard similarity of 0.24, roughly equivalent to two ten-word captions having in common four words with the same root, indicating that the captions are dissimilar while they still contain some of the same information.",

title     = "Automatic word count estimation from daylong child-centered recordings in various language environments using language-independent syllabification of speech",
abstract  = "Automatic word count estimation (WCE) from audio recordings can be used to quantify the amount of verbal communication in a recording environment. One key application of WCE is to measure language input heard by infants and toddlers in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings from microphones worn by the infants. Although WCE is nearly trivial for high-quality signals in high-resource languages, daylong recordings are substantially more challenging due to the unconstrained acoustic environments and the presence of near- and far-field speech. Moreover, many use cases of interest involve languages for which reliable ASR systems or even well-defined lexicons are not available. A good WCE system should also perform similarly for low- and high-resource languages in order to enable unbiased comparisons across different cultures and environments. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art solution, the LENA system, is based on proprietary software and has only been optimized for American English, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we build on existing work on WCE and present the steps we have taken towards a freely available system for WCE that can be adapted to different languages or dialects with a limited amount of orthographically transcribed speech data. Our system is based on language-independent syllabification of speech, followed by a language-dependent mapping from syllable counts (and a number of other acoustic features) to the corresponding word count estimates. We evaluate our system on samples from daylong infant recordings from six different corpora consisting of several languages and socioeconomic environments, all manually annotated with the same protocol to allow direct comparison. We compare a number of alternative techniques for the two key components in our system: speech activity detection and automatic syllabification of speech. As a result, we show that our system can reach relatively consistent WCE accuracy across multiple corpora and languages (with some limitations). In addition, the system outperforms LENA on three of the four corpora consisting of different varieties of English. We also demonstrate how an automatic neural network-based syllabifier, when trained on multiple languages, generalizes well to novel languages beyond the training data, outperforming two previously proposed unsupervised syllabifiers as a feature extractor for WCE.",

abstract  = "The majority of sound scene analysis work focuses on one of two clearly defined tasks: acoustic scene classification or sound event detection. Whilst this separation of tasks is useful for problem definition, they inherently ignore some subtleties of the real-world, in particular how humans vary in how they describe a scene. Some will describe the weather and features within it, others will use a holistic descriptor like {\textquoteleft}park{\textquoteright}, and others still will use unique identifiers such as cities or names. In this paper, we undertake the task of automatic city classification to ask whether we can recognize a city from a set of sound scenesƒ In this problem each city has recordings from multiple scenes. We test a series of methods for this novel task and show that a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve accuracy of 50\%. This is less than the acoustic scene classification task baseline in the DCASE 2018 ASC challenge on the same data. A simple adaptation to the class labels of pairing city labels with grouped scenes, accuracy increases to 52\%, closer to the simpler scene classification task. Finally we also formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework and achieve an accuracy of 56\%, outperforming the aforementioned approaches.",

For detection, the method employs a convolutional neural network trained to detect the seizure events in short time segments, based on mel-energies as feature representation.

Both the ensemble and the neural network fusion of magnitude spectra obtained with these approaches have been shown to improve the objective perceptual quality with synthetic mixtures of data. This work generalizes the ensemble approach by proposing neural network layers to predict time-frequency varying weights for the combination of the two magnitude spectra. In order to combine the best individual magnitude spectrum estimates, the weight prediction network is trained after the time-frequency mask and magnitude spectrum sub-networks have been separately trained for their corresponding objectives and their weights have been frozen. Using the publicly available CHiME3 -challenge data, which consists of both simulated and real speech recordings in everyday environments with noise and interference, the proposed approach leads to significantly higher noise suppression in terms of segmental source-to-distortion ratio over the alternative approaches. In addition, the approach achieves similar improvements in the average objective instrumentally measured intelligibility scores with respect to the best achieved scores. ",

In this paper, we present three tasks, including the datasets and baseline systems, and analyze the challenge entries for each task. We observe the popularity of methods using deep neural networks, and the still widely used mel frequency-based representations, with only few approaches standing out as radically different. Analysis of the systems behavior reveals that task-specific optimization has a big role in producing good performance; however, often this optimization closely follows the ranking metric, and its maximization/minimization does not result in universally good performance. We also introduce the calculation of confidence intervals based on a jackknife resampling procedure to perform statistical analysis of the challenge results.

abstract  = "This paper proposes a low algorithmic latency adaptation of the deep clustering approach to speaker-independent speech separation. It consists of three parts: a) the usage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks instead of their bidirectional variant used in the original work, b) using a short synthesis window (here 8 ms) required for low-latency operation, and, c) using a buffer in the beginning of audio mixture to estimate cluster centres corresponding to constituent speakers which are then utilized to separate speakers within the rest of the signal. The buffer duration would serve as an initialization phase after which the system is capable of operating with 8 ms algorithmic latency. We evaluate our proposed approach on two-speaker mixtures from Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus. We observe that the use of LSTM yields around one dB lower SDR as compared to the baseline bidirectional LSTM in terms of source to distortion ratio (SDR). Moreover, using an 8 ms synthesis window instead of 32 ms degrades the separation performance by around 2.1 dB as compared to the baseline. Finally, we also report separation performance with different buffer durations noting that separation can be achieved even for buffer duration as low as 300 ms.",

abstract  = "The Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of a sound wavefront impinging on a microphone pair carries spatial information about the source. However, captured speech typically contains dynamic non-speech interference sources and noise. Therefore, the TDoA estimates fluctuate between speech and interference. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied for Time-Frequency (TF) masking for Acoustic Source Localization (ASL) to filter out non-speech components from a speaker location likelihood function. However, the type of TF mask for this task is not obvious. Secondly, the DNN should estimate the TDoA values, but existing solutions estimate the TF mask instead. To overcome these issues, a direct formulation of the TF masking as a part of a DNN-based ASL structure is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed network operates in an online manner, i.e., producing estimates frame-by-frame. Combined with the use of recurrent layers it exploits the sequential progression of speaker related TDoAs. Training with different microphone spacings allows model re-use for different microphone pair geometries in inference. Real-data experiments with smartphone recordings of speech in interference demonstrate the network's generalization capability.",

In this study, we propose the use of cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGANs) for converting styles with varying vocal effort, and focus on conversion between normal and Lombard styles as a case study of this problem. We propose a parametric approach that uses the Pulse Model in Log domain (PML) vocoder to extract speech features. These features are mapped using the CycleGAN from utterances in the source style to the corresponding features of target speech. Finally, the mapped features are converted to a Lombard speech waveform with the PML. The CycleGAN was compared in subjective listening tests with 2 other standard mapping methods used in conversion, and the CycleGAN was found to have the best performance in terms of speech quality and in terms of the magnitude of the perceptual change between the two styles.",

title     = "Sound Event Envelope Estimation in Polyphonic Mixtures",
abstract  = "Sound event detection is the task of identifying automatically the presence and temporal boundaries of sound events within an input audio stream. In the last years, deep learning methods have established themselves as the state-of-the-art approach for the task, using binary indicators during training to denote whether an event is active or inactive. However, such binary activity indicators do not fully describe the events, and estimating the envelope of the sounds could provide more precise modeling of their activity. This paper proposes to estimate the amplitude envelopes of target sound event classes in polyphonic mixtures. For training, we use the amplitude envelopes of the target sounds, calculated from mixture signals and, for comparison, from their isolated counterparts. The model is then used to perform envelope estimation and sound event detection. Results show that the envelope estimation allows good modeling of the sounds activity, with detection results comparable to current state-of-the art.",

The performance of ASNA has been proved in previous works against other state-of-the-art methods. The implementations analysed in this paper have been developed in C, using parallel programming techniques to obtain a better performance in multicore architectures than the original MATLAB implementation. Also a hardware analysis is performed to check the influence of CPU frequency and number of CPU cores in the different implementations proposed.

title     = "Sound Event Localization and Detection of Overlapping Sources Using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks",
abstract  = "In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network for joint sound event localization and detection (SELD) of multiple overlapping sound events in three-dimensional (3D) space. The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values, reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in comparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of overlapping sound events.",

In this study, we aim to provide a general SSC system for converting styles with varying vocal effort and focus on normal-to-Lombard conversion as a case study of this problem. We propose a parametric approach that uses a vocoder to extract speech features. These features are mapped using parallel machine learning models from utterances spoken in normal style to the corresponding features of Lombard speech. Finally, the mapped features are converted to a Lombard speech waveform with the vocoder. A total of three vocoders (GlottDNN, STRAIGHT, and Pulse model in log domain (PML)) and three machine learning mapping methods (standard GMM, Bayesian GMM, and feed-forward DNN) were compared in the proposed normal-to-Lombard style conversion system. The conversion was evaluated using two subjective listening tests measuring perceived Lombardness and quality of the converted speech signals, and by using an instrumental measure called Speech Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB) for speech intelligibility evaluation under various noise levels. The results of the subjective tests show that the system is able to convert normal speech into Lombard speech and that there is a trade-off between quality and Lombardness of the mapped utterances. The GlottDNN and PML stand out as the best vocoders in terms of quality and Lombardness, respectively, whereas the DNN is the best mapping method in terms of Lombardness. PML with the standard GMM seems to give a good compromise between the two attributes. The SIIB experiments indicate that intelligibility of converted speech compared to that of normal speech improved in noisy conditions most effectively when DNN mapping was used with STRAIGHT and PML.",

The cascade structure is computationally efficient by providing the possibility to early termination. For the proposed Boolean combination function, the computational load of classification is reduced whenever the function becomes determinate before all the component detectors have been utilized. We also propose an algorithm, which selects all the needed thresholds for the component detectors within the proposed Boolean combination. We present results on two audio-visual datasets, which prove the efficiency of the proposed combination framework. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially reduced computation time in laughter detection task, and our algorithm finds better thresholds for the component detectors within the Boolean combination than the other algorithms found in the literature.",

The proposed method performs K-medoids clustering over an initially unlabeled dataset, and medoids as local representatives, are presented to an annotator for manual annotation. The annotated label on a medoid propagates to other samples in its cluster for label prediction. After annotating the medoids, the annotation continues to the unexamined sounds with mismatched prediction results from two classifiers, a nearest-neighbor classifier and a model-based classifier, both trained with annotated data. The annotation on the segments with mismatched predictions are ordered by the distance to the nearest annotated sample, farthest first. The evaluation is made on a public environmental sound dataset. The labels obtained through a labeling process controlled by the proposed method are used to train a classifier, using supervised learning. Only 20\% of the data needs to be manually annotated with the proposed method, to achieve the accuracy with all the data annotated.

We show that the proposed loss function can offer improved or at par objective intelligibility (in terms of ESTOI) compared to an MSE optimized baseline while resulting in lower objective separation performance (in terms of the source to distortion ratio (SDR)). We then proceed to propose an approach where the network is first initialized with weights optimized for MSE criterion and then trained with the proposed ESTOI loss criterion.

STFT phase globally appears as uniformly distributed, which has led researchers in this field to model it as a uniform random variable. However, some information about the phase can be obtained from a sinusoidal model, which reveals its local structure. Therefore, we propose to model the phase with a von Mises (VM) random variable, which enables us to favor the sinusoidal model-based phase value. We estimate the distribution parameters and we validate this model on real audio data. In particular, we observe that both models (uniform and VM) are relevant from a statistical perspective but they convey different information about the phase (global vs. local). We also apply this VM model to an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous approaches.",

As the main contribution different neural network models are experimentally compared to investigate computational complexity and speech enhancement performance. The proposed system is trained and tested on noisy speech data where signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges from -5 dB to +5 dB and the results show significant reduction of non-speech content in the resulting signal while still meeting a low-latency operation criterion, which is here considered to be less than 20 ms.",

title     = "Complex ISNMF: a phase-aware model for monaural audio source separation",
abstract  = "This paper introduces a phase-aware probabilistic model for audio source separation. Classical source models in the short-term Fourier transform domain use circularly-symmetric Gaussian or Poisson random variables. This is equivalent to assuming that the phase of each source is uniformly distributed, which is not suitable for exploiting the underlying structure of the phase. Drawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian source model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us to favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov chain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex Itakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of non-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a distortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which preserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables one to account for some phase constraints. We derive a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Experiments conducted on a musical source separation task in a semi-informed setting show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art phase-aware separation techniques.",

abstract  = "Sound event detection systems typically consist of two stages: Extracting hand-crafted features from the raw audio waveform, and learning a mapping between these features and the target sound events using a classifier. Recently, the focus of sound event detection research has been mostly shifted to the latter stage using standard features such as mel spectrogram as the input for classifiers such as deep neural networks. In this work, we utilize end-to-end approach and propose to combine these two stages in a single deep neural network classifier. The feature extraction over the raw waveform is conducted by a feedforward layer block, whose parameters are initialized to extract the time-frequency representations. The feature extraction parameters are updated during training, resulting with a representation that is optimized for the specific task. This feature extraction block is followed by (and jointly trained with) a convolutional recurrent network, which has recently given state-of-the-art results in many sound recognition tasks. The proposed system does not outperform a convolutional recurrent network with fixed hand-crafted features. The final magnitude spectrum characteristics of the feature extraction block parameters indicate that the most relevant information for the given task is contained in 0 - 3 kHz frequency range, and this is also supported by the empirical results on the SED performance.",

abstract  = "In this paper, we propose a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network (CRNN) with a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) in the first layer for the multichannel sound event detection (SED) task. The 3D CNN enables the network to simultaneously learn the inter-and intra-channel features from the input multichannel audio. In order to evaluate the proposed method, multichannel audio datasets with different number of overlapping sound sources are synthesized. Each of this dataset has a four-channel first-order Ambisonic, binaural, and single-channel versions, on which the performance of SED using the proposed method are compared to study the potential of SED using multichannel audio. A similar study is also done with the binaural and single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development dataset. The proposed method learns to recognize overlapping sound events from multichannel features faster and performs better SED with a fewer number of training epochs. The results show that on using multichannel Ambisonic audio in place of single-channel audio we improve the overall F-score by 7.5\%, overall error rate by 10\% and recognize 15.6\% more sound events in time frames with four overlapping sound sources.",

The algorithm is formulated as adaptive convolutive filtering in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. We use the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for estimating the filter parameters due to its fast convergence rate, which is required for modeling rapidly changing RIRs of moving sound sources. The proposed method allows separation of reverberated sources from the far-field mixture given that their close-field signals are available. The evaluation is based on measuring unmixing performance (removal of reverberated source) using objective separation criteria calculated between the ground truth recording of the preserved sources and the unmixing result obtained with the proposed algorithm. We compare online and offline formulations for the RIR estimation and also provide evaluation with blind source separation algorithm only operating on the mixture signal.",

abstract  = "This paper presents an algorithm for multichannel sound source separation using explicit modeling of level and time differences in source spatial covariance matrices (SCM). We propose a novel SCM model in which the spatial properties are modeled by the weighted sum of direction of arrival (DOA) kernels. DOA kernels are obtained as the combination of phase and level difference covariance matrices representing both time and level differences between microphones for a grid of predefined source directions. The proposed SCM model is combined with the NMF model for the magnitude spectrograms. Opposite to other SCM models in the literature, in this work, source localization is implicitly defined in the model and estimated during the signal factorization. Therefore, no localization pre-processing is required. Parameters are estimated using complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) with both Euclidean distance and Itakura Saito divergence. Separation performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the two-channel SiSEC development dataset and four channels signals recorded in a regular room with moderate reverberation. Finally, a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods is performed, showing better achieved separation performance in terms of SIR and perceptual measures.",

abstract  = "State-of-the-art methods for monaural singing voice separation consist in estimating the magnitude spectrum of the voice in the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) domain by means of deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting magnitude estimate is then combined with the mixture's phase to retrieve the complex-valued STFT of the voice, which is further synthesized into a time-domain signal. However, when the sources overlap in time and frequency, the STFT phase of the voice differs from the mixture's phase, which results in interference and artifacts in the estimated signals. In this paper, we investigate on recent phase recovery algorithms that tackle this issue and can further enhance the separation quality. These algorithms exploit phase constraints that originate from a sinusoidal model or from consistency , a property that is a direct consequence of the STFT redundancy. Experiments conducted on real music songs show that those algorithms are efficient for reducing interference in the estimated voice compared to the baseline approach.",

While its estimation was originally based on the Euclidean distance, in this paper we propose to extend it to any beta-divergence, a family of functions widely used in audio to estimate NMF. To this end, we introduce the beta-divergence in a heuristic fashion within a phase-aware probabilistic model. Estimating this model results in performing an NMF with Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence on a quantity called the phase-corrected posterior power of the sources, which is both phase-dependent and nonnegative-valued. Therefore, we replace IS with the beta-divergence, so that the factorization uses an optimal distortion metric and remains phase-aware. Even though by doing so we loose theoretical convergence guarantees, the resulting algorithm demonstrates its potential for an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous complex NMFs approaches.",

abstract  = "Hearing aid users are challenged in listening situations with noise and especially speech-on-speech situations with two or more competing voices. Specifically, the task of attending to and segregating two competing voices is particularly hard, unlike for normal-hearing listeners, as shown in a small sub-experiment. In the main experiment, the competing voices benefit of a deep neural network (DNN) based stream segregation enhancement algorithm was tested on hearing-impaired listeners. A mixture of two voices was separated using a DNN and presented to the two ears as individual streams and tested for word score. Compared to the unseparated mixture, there was a 13\%-point benefit from the separation, while attending to both voices. If only one output was selected as in a traditional target-masker scenario, a larger benefit of 37\%-points was found. The results agreed well with objective metrics and show that for hearing-impaired listeners, DNNs have a large potential for improving stream segregation and speech intelligibility in difficult scenarios with two equally important targets without any prior selection of a primary target stream. An even higher benefit can be obtained if the user can select the preferred target via remote control.",

In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present in detail each task and analyse the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.",

In this study, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based audio segmentation method to identify the relevant acoustic parts of the cry signal (i.e., expiratory and inspiratory phases) from recordings made in natural environments with various interfering acoustic sources. We examine and optimize the performance of the system by using different audio features and HMM topologies. In particular, we propose using fundamental frequency and aperiodicity features. We also propose a method for adapting the segmentation system trained on acoustic material captured in a particular acoustic environment to a different acoustic environment by using feature normalization and semi-supervised learning (SSL). The performance of the system was evaluated by analyzing a total of 3 h and 10 min of audio material from 109 infants, captured in a variety of recording conditions in hospital wards and clinics. The proposed system yields frame-based accuracy up to 89.2\%. We conclude that the proposed system offers a solution for automated segmentation of cry signals in cry analysis applications.",

title     = "Environmental noise monitoring using source classification in sensors",
abstract  = "Environmental noise monitoring systems continuously measure sound levels without assigning these measurements to different noise sources in the acoustic scenes, therefore incapable of identifying the main noise source. In this paper a feasibility study is presented on a new monitoring concept in which an acoustic pattern classification algorithm running in a wireless sensor is used to automatically assign the measured sound level to different noise sources. A supervised noise source classifier is learned from a small amount of manually annotated recordings and the learned classifier is used to automatically detect the activity of target noise source in the presence of interfering noise sources. The sensor is based on an inexpensive credit-card-sized single-board computer with a microphone and associated electronics and wireless connectivity. The measurement results and the noise source information are transferred from the sensors scattered around the measurement site to a cloud service and a noise portal is used to visualise the measurements to users. The proposed noise monitoring concept was piloted on a rock crushing site. The system ran reliably over 50 days on site, during which it was able to recognise more than 90\% of the noise sources correctly. The pilot study shows that the proposed noise monitoring system can reduce the amount of required human validation of the sound level measurements when the target noise source is clearly defined.",

We propose to explore more exhaustively those algorithms, in particular the choice of the methodology (standard EM or SAGE variant) and the latent variable set (full or reduced). We then derive four EM-based algorithms, among which three are novel. Speech separation experiments show that one of those novel algorithms using a standard EM methodology and a reduced set of latent variables outperforms its SAGE variants and competes with the conventional multiplicative algorithm.",

In many cases the masking process is not a learnable function or is not encapsulated into the deep learning optimization. Consequently, most of the existing methods rely on a post processing step using the generalized Wiener filtering. This work proposes a method that learns and optimizes (during training) a source-dependent mask and does not need the aforementioned post processing step. We introduce a recurrent inference algorithm, a sparse transformation step to improve the mask generation process, and a learned denoising filter. Obtained results show an increase of 0.49 dB for the signal to distortion ratio and 0.30 dB for the signal to interference ratio, compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for monaural singing voice separation.

We propose a novel multichannel NMF model with time-varying mixing of the sources denoted by spatial covariance matrices (SCM) and provide update equations for optimizing model parameters minimizing squared Frobenius norm. The SCMs of the model are obtained based on estimated directions of arrival of tracked sources at each time frame. The evaluation is based on established objective separation criteria and using real recordings of two and three simultaneous moving sound sources. The compared methods include conventional beamforming and ideal ratio mask separation. The proposed method is shown to exceed the separation quality of other evaluated blind approaches according to all measured quantities. Additionally, we evaluate the method's susceptibility towards tracking errors by comparing the separation quality achieved using annotated ground truth source trajectories.",

The proposed method was applied to speaker identification and separation tasks. The experimental results show that dictionaries obtained by the BNMD bring much higher speaker identification accuracies averaged over a range of SNRs from -6 dB to 9 dB (91.3\%) than the NMD-based dictionaries (37.8-75.4\%).

abstract  = "The objective of deep learning methods based on encoder-decoder architectures for music source separation is to approximate either ideal time-frequency masks or spectral representations of the target music source(s). The spectral representations are then used to derive time-frequency masks. In this work we introduce a method to directly learn time-frequency masks from an observed mixture magnitude spectrum. We employ recurrent neural networks and train them using prior knowledge only for the magnitude spectrum of the target source. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we focus on the task of singing voice separation. The results from an objective evaluation show that our proposed method provides comparable results to deep learning based methods which operate over complicated signal representations. Compared to previous methods that approximate time-frequency masks, our method has increased performance of signal to distortion ratio by an average of 3.8 dB.",

This paper shows preliminary results using ASR in Chilean and Finnish middle and high school to automatically provide teachers a visualization of the structure of concepts present in their discourse in science classrooms. These visualizations are conceptual networks that relate key concepts used by the teacher. This is an interesting tool that gives feedback to the teacher about his/her pedagogical practice in classes.

The encoder is a multi-layered, bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the decoder a multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected layers with shared weights between timesteps. The proposed method is evaluated using data drawn from a commercial sound effects library, ProSound Effects.

abstract  = "Close miking represents a widely employed practice of placing a microphone very near to the sound source in order to capture more direct sound and minimize any pickup of ambient sound, including other, concurrently active sources. It is used by the audio engineering community for decades for audio recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the recording practice itself. But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For all the above cases we calculate the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric. The results obtained clearly demonstrate an optimum close-miking performance that matches the current empirical knowledge of professional audio recording.",

abstract  = "For audio source separation applications, it is common to apply a Wiener-like filtering to a time-frequency (TF) representation of the data, such as the short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). This approach, in which the phase of the original mixture is assigned to each component, is limited when sources overlap in the TF domain. In this paper, we propose to improve this technique by accounting for two properties of the phase. First, we model the sources by anisotropic Gaussian variables: This model accounts for the non-uniformity of the phase, and permits us to incorporate some prior information about the phase that originates from a sinusoidal model. Second, we exploit the STFT consistency, which is the relationship between STFT coefficients that is due to the redundancy of the STFT. We derive a conjugate gradient algorithm for estimating the corresponding filter, which we refer to as the consistent anisotropic Wiener filter. Experiments conducted on music pieces show that the proposed approach yields results similar to or better than the state-of-The-Art with a dramatic reduction of the computation time.",

In the homogeneous recognition scenario, the classification accuracy using cross-validation on TUT-vocal-2016 was 95.5\%. In heterogeneous recognition scenario, seven existing datasets were used as training material and TUT-vocal-2016 was used for testing, the classification accuracy was only 69.6\%.

abstract  = "The steered response power (SRP) methods can be used to build a map of sound direction likelihood. In the presence of interference and reverberation, the map will exhibit multiple peaks with heights related to the corresponding sound's spectral content. Often in realistic use cases, the target of interest (such as speech) can exhibit a lower peak compared to an interference source. This will corrupt any direction dependent method, such as beamforming. Regression has been used to predict time-frequency (TF) regions corrupted by reverberation, and static broadband noise can be efficiently estimated for TF points. TF regions dominated by noise or reverberation can then be de-emphasized to obtain more reliable source direction estimates. In this work, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the prediction of a TF mask for emphasizing the direct path speech signal in time-varying interference. SRP with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) combined with the CNN-based masking is shown to be capable of reducing the impact of time-varying interference for speaker direction estimation using real speech sources in reverberation.",

New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c).

The most common signal enhancement techniques for microphone arrays are based on the design of directional filters or beamforming. This chapter provides a brief overview of these techniques, with a focus on post-filtering techniques. In adaptive beamformers there is a trade-off between directional selectivity and noise amplification which can be observed in the directivity factor. A class of adaptive beamformers are described as part of the informed spatial filters that combine beamforming with noise reduction. Time-frequency masking is commonly applied at the output of the beamformer to adjust the spectrum to better match that of the desired source signal. The post-filters are only capable of reducing uncorrelated or correlated noise in the beamforming output, and rely on the output of the beamformer for the suppression of the interference.",

For the problems which lack data sufficient to achieve high performance, methods for transfer learning can be applied. These refer to performing the new task while having prior knowledge of the nature of the data, gained by first performing a different task, for which training data is abundant. Shown successful for other machine learning tasks, transfer learning is now investigated in audio analysis. We propose to solve the weakly labelled problem of sound event tagging with small amounts of training data by transferring the abstract knowledge about the nature of audio data from another tagging task.

Several architectures for such transfer are proposed and evaluated, showing impressive classification accuracy of 83.4\% with gains of up to 20 percentage points over the baseline given as little as 36 training samples for the target task.",

title     = "Blind Separation of Audio Mixtures Through Nonnegative Tensor Factorization of Modulation Spectrograms",
abstract  = "This paper presents an algorithm for unsupervised single-channel source separation of audio mixtures. The approach specifically addresses the challenging case of separation where no training data are available. By representing mixtures in the modulation spectrogram (MS) domain, we exploit underlying similarities in patterns present across frequency. A three-dimensional tensor factorization is able to take advantage of these redundant patterns, and is used to separate a mixture into an approximated sum of components by minimizing a divergence cost. Furthermore, we show that the basic tensor factorization can be extended with convolution in time being used to improve separation results and provide update rules to learn components in such a manner. Following factorization, sources are reconstructed in the audio domain from estimated components using a novel approach based on reconstruction masks that are learned using MS activations, and then applied to a mixture spectrogram. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior separation performance to a spectrally based nonnegative matrix factorization approach, in terms of source-to-distortion ratio. We also compare separation with the perceptually motivated interference-related perceptual score metric and identify cases with higher performance.",

title     = "Self-localization of dynamic user-worn microphones from observed speech",
abstract  = "Abstract The increase of mobile devices and most recently wearables has raised the interest to utilize their sensors for various applications such as indoor localization. We present the first acoustic self-localization scheme that is passive, and is capable of operating when sensors are moving, and possibly unsynchronized. As a result, the relative microphone positions are obtained and therefore an ad hoc microphone array has been established. The proposed system takes advantage of the knowledge that a device is worn by its user e.g. attached to his/her clothing. A user here acts as a sound source and the sensor is the user-worn microphone. Such an entity is referred to as a node. Node-related spatial information is obtained from Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimated from audio captured by the nodes. Kalman filtering is used for node tracking and prediction of spatial information during periods of node silence. Finally, the node positions are recovered using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The only information required by the proposed system is observations of sounds produced by the nodes such as speech to localize the moving nodes. The general framework for acoustic self-localization is presented followed by an implementation to demonstrate the concept. Real data collected by off-the-shelf equipment is used to evaluate the positioning accuracy of nodes in contrast to image based method. The presented system achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 cm in an acoustic laboratory.",

abstract  = "Deep learning techniques such as deep feedforward neural networks and deep convolutional neural networks have recently been shown to improve the performance in sound event detection compared to traditional methods such as Gaussian mixture models. One of the key factors of this improvement is the capability of deep architectures to automatically learn higher levels of acoustic features in each layer. In this work, we aim to combine the feature learning capabilities of deep architectures with the empirical knowledge of human perception. We use the first layer of a deep neural network to learn a mapping from a high-resolution magnitude spectrum to smaller amount of frequency bands, which effectively learns a filterbank for the sound event detection task. We initialize the first hidden layer weights to match with the perceptually motivated mel filterbank magnitude response. We also integrate this initialization scheme with context windowing by using an appropriately constrained deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method does not only result with better detection accuracy, but also provides insight on the frequencies deemed essential for better discrimination of given sound events.",

abstract  = "Speech signals captured by distant microphones in enclosures are typically deteriorated by reverberation and background noise. Commonly, the quality of the signals is enhanced applying delay and sum beamforming (or variants) to a microphone array. However, under particular conditions, the multi-path acoustic propagation leading to reverberation is not completely detrimental and can be used in a constructive way. In this direction, mirrored (virtual) microphones have been successfully applied in various research areas. In addition, the majority of naturally occurring sound sources, such as the human speaker, presents a certain degree of radiation directivity, which, coupled with data-independent beamforming, has been shown to slightly increase the captured speech quality. Building upon the concepts of environment awareness and the acoustic rake receiver, this paper investigates the use of mirrored microphones, associated to isolated and strong reflections, in combination with source directivity, to further improve the captured speech quality. Real-data gathered with a linear nested array, as well as simulated data, are used to test the proposed scheme, showing superior performance with respect to similar state of the art solutions.",

Does the emotional impact arise from the fact that the listener recognizes that a gun produced the sound (semantic content) or does it arise from the attributes of the sound created by the firing gun? This research explores the relation between the semantic similarity of the sound events and the elicited emotions. Results indicate that the semantic content seems to have a limited role in the conformation of the listener{\textquoteright}s affective states. However, when the semantic content is matched to specific areas in the Arousal-Valence space or when the source{\textquoteright}s spatial position is considered, the effect of the semantic content is higher, especially for the cases of medium to low valence and medium to high arousal or when the sound source is at the lateral positions of the listener{\textquoteright}s head.",

With respect to the genre and style of the audio content, the parameters of these techniques are controlled by a mastering engineer, in order to process the original audio material. This operation relies on musical and perceptually pleasing facets of the perceived acoustic characteristics, transmitted from the audio material under the mastering process. Modeling such dynamic operations, which involve adaptation regarding the audio content, becomes vital in automated applications since it significantly affects the overall performance. In this work we present a system capable of modelling such behavior focusing on the automatic dynamic range compression. It predicts frequency coefficients that allow the dynamic range compression, via a trained deep neural network, and applies them to unmastered audio signal served as input. Both dynamic range compression and the prediction of the corresponding frequency coefficients take place inside the time-frequency domain, using magnitude spectra acquired from a critical band filter bank, similar to humans{\textquoteright} peripheral auditory system.

The proposed processing is separating the scene into a sum of small number of sources, and the spectrogram of each of them is in turn represented as a small number of latent components. The direction of arrival (DOA) of each source is estimated, which is followed by binaural rendering of each source at its estimated direction. For representing the sources, the proposed method uses low-rank complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization combined with DOA-based spatial covariance matrix model. The binaural reconstruction is achieved by applying the binaural cues (head-related transfer function) associated with the estimated source DOA to the separated source signals. The binaural rendering quality of the proposed method was evaluated using a speech intelligibility test. The test results indicated that the proposed binaural rendering was able to improve the intelligibility of speech over stereo recordings and separation by minimum variance distortionless response beamformer with the same binaural synthesis in a three-speaker scenario. An additional listening test evaluating the subjective quality of the rendered output indicates no added processing artifacts by the proposed method in comparison to unprocessed stereo recording.",

To obtain the decomposition, exemplars sampled in lower dimensional spaces are preferred over the full-resolution frequency domain for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize to unseen cases. But the resulting filter may be sub-optimal as the mapping of the obtained speech and noise estimates to the full-resolution frequency domain yields a low-rank approximation. This paper proposes an efficient way to directly compute the full-resolution frequency estimates of speech and noise using coupled dictionaries: an input dictionary containing atoms from the desired exemplar space to obtain the decomposition and a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars from the full-resolution frequency domain. We also introduce modulation spectrogram features for the exemplar-based tasks using this approach. The proposed system was evaluated for various choices of input exemplars and yielded improved speech enhancement performances on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 databases. We further show that the proposed approach also results in improved word error rates (WERs) for the speech recognition tasks using HMM-GMM and deep-neural network (DNN) based systems.",

title     = "Low-Latency Sound-Source-Separation using Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation with Coupled Analysis and Synthesis Dictionaries",
abstract  = "For real-time or close to real-time applications, sound source separation can be performed on-line, where new frames of incoming data for a mixture signal are processed as they arrive, at very low delay. We propose an approach which generates the separation filters for short synthesis frames to achieve low latency source separation, based on a compositional model mixture of the audio to be separated. Filter parameters are derived from a longer temporal context than the current processing frame through use of a longer analysis frame. A pair of dictionaries are used, one for analysis and one for reconstruction. With this approach we are able to increase separation performance at low latencies whilst retaining the low-latency provided by the use of short synthesis frames. The proposed data handling scheme and parameters can be adjusted to achieve real-time performance, given sufficient computational power. Low-latency output allows a human listener to use the results of such a separation scheme directly, without a perceptible delay. With the proposed method, separated source-to-distortion ratios (SDRs) can be improved by over 1 dB for latencies below 20 ms, without any affect on latency.",

abstract  = "Non-negative matrix factorisations are used in several branches of signal processing and data analysis for separation and classification. Sparsity constraints are commonly set on the model to promote discovery of a small number of dominant patterns. In group sparse models, atoms considered to belong to a consistent group are permitted to activate together, while activations across groups are suppressed, reducing the number of simultaneously active sources or other structures. Whereas most group sparse models require explicit division of atoms into separate groups without addressing their mutual relations, we propose a constraint that permits dynamic relationships between atoms or groups, based on any defined distance measure. The resulting solutions promote approximation with components considered similar to each other. Evaluation results are shown for speech enhancement and noise robust speech and speaker recognition.",

The commonly used spectral features take into account merely the magnitude information, whereas the phase is overlooked due to the complications related to its interpretation. Additional information concealed in the phase is hypothesised to be beneficial for sound event recognition. The APGD is an approach to inferring phase information, which has shown applicability for analysis of speech and music signals and is now studied in environmental audio. The evaluation is performed within a multi-label deep neural network (DNN) framework on a diverse real-life dataset of environmental sounds. It shows performance improvement compared to the baseline log mel-band energy case. In combination with the magnitude-based features, APGD demonstrates further improvement.",

According to recent studies, such fluctuations also lead to a favored listening experience. The scaling laws of amplitude variations in rhythms, however, are widely unknown. Here we use highly sensitive onset detection and time series analysis to study the amplitude and temporal fluctuations of Jeff Porcaro's one-handed hi-hat pattern in {"}I Keep Forgettin'''-one of the most renowned 16th note patterns in modern drumming. We show that fluctuations of hi-hat amplitudes and interbeat intervals (times between hits) have clear long-range correlations and short-range anticorrelations separated by a characteristic time scale. In addition, we detect subtle features in Porcaro's drumming such as small drifts in the 16th note pulse and non-trivial periodic two-bar patterns in both hi-hat amplitudes and intervals. Through this investigation we introduce a step towards statistical studies of the 20th and 21st century music recordings in the framework of complex systems. Our analysis has direct applications to the development of drum machines and to drumming pedagogy.",

abstract  = "This paper investigates methods for quantifying similarity between audio signals, specifically for the task of cover song detection. We consider an information-theoretic approach, where we compute pairwise measures of predictability between time series. We compare discrete-valued approaches operating on quantized audio features, to continuous-valued approaches. In the discrete case, we propose a method for computing the normalized compression distance, where we account for correlation between time series. In the continuous case, we propose to compute information-based measures of similarity as statistics of the prediction error between time series. We evaluate our methods on two cover song identification tasks using a data set comprised of 300 Jazz standards and using the Million Song Dataset. For both datasets, we observe that continuous-valued approaches outperform discrete-valued approaches. We consider approaches to estimating the normalized compression distance (NCD) based on string compression and prediction, where we observe that our proposed normalized compression distance with alignment (NCDA) improves average performance over NCD, for sequential compression algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that continuous-valued distances may be combined to improve performance with respect to baseline approaches. Using a large-scale filter-and-refine approach, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for cover song identification using the Million Song Dataset.",

Archetypes refer to so-called pure types, which are a combination of a few data points and which can be combined to obtain a data point.

The algorithm performs archetypal analysis that minimises the generalised Kullback-Leibler divergence, shown suitable for audio, between an observation and the model. The methodology is evaluated in a source separation scenario (mixtures of speech) and shows results, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art, with perceptual measures indicating its superiority over all of the competing methods in the case of medium-size dictionaries.",

title     = "Distant speech separation using predicted time-frequency masks from spatial features",
abstract  = "Speech separation algorithms are faced with a difficult task of producing high degree of separation without containing unwanted artifacts. The time-frequency (T-F) masking technique applies a real-valued (or binary) mask on top of the signal's spectrum to filter out unwanted components. The practical difficulty lies in the mask estimation. Often, using efficient masks engineered for separation performance leads to presence of unwanted musical noise artifacts in the separated signal. This lowers the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the output. Microphone arrays have been long studied for processing of distant speech. This work uses a feed-forward neural network for mapping microphone array's spatial features into a T-F mask. Wiener filter is used as a desired mask for training the neural network using speech examples in simulated setting. The T-F masks predicted by the neural network are combined to obtain an enhanced separation mask that exploits the information regarding interference between all sources. The final mask is applied to the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) output. The algorithm's objective separation capability in conjunction with the separated speech intelligibility is tested with recorded speech from distant talkers in two rooms from two distances. The results show improvement in instrumental measure for intelligibility and frequency-weighted SNR over complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation approach, spatial sound source separation, and conventional beamforming methods such as the DSB and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR).",

abstract  = "Recognition and classification of speech content in everyday environments is challenging due to the large diversity of real-world noise sources, which may also include competing speech. At signal-to-noise ratios below 0 dB, a majority of features may become corrupted, severely degrading the performance of classifiers built upon clean observations of a target class. As the energy and complexity of competing sources increase, their explicit modelling becomes integral for successful detection and classification of target speech. We have previously demonstrated how non-negative compositional modelling in a spectrogram space is suitable for robust recognition of speech and speakers even at low SNRs. In this work, the sparse coding approach is extended to cover the whole separation and classification chain to recognise the speaker of short utterances in difficult noise environments. A convolutive matrix factorisation and coding system is evaluated on 2nd CHiME Track 1 data. Over 98\% average speaker recognition accuracy is achieved for shorter than three second utterances at +9 … -6 dB SNR, illustrating the system's performance in challenging conditions. ",

In contrast to typical methods known from the literature, which are based on the assumption that the desired signal dominates (for example GMM-UBM, joint factor analysis, i-vectors), compositional models such as NMD describe a recording as a non-negative combination of latent components. The proposed model represents a spectrogram of a signal as a sum of spectrotemporal patterns that span durations of order about 150 ms, while many state of the art automatic speaker recognition systems model a probability distribution of features extracted from much shorter excerpts of speech signal (about 50 ms). Longer patterns carry information about dynamical aspects of modeled signal, for example information about accent and articulation. We use a parametric dictionary in the NMD and the parameters of the dictionary carry information about the speakers{\textquoteright} identity. The experiments performed on the CHiME corpus show that with the proposed approach achieves equal error rate comparable to an i-vector based system.",

A mixture signal is separated through factorisation of a feature-tensor representation, based on the modulation spectrogram. Harmonically related components tend to modulate in a similar fashion, and this redundancy of patterns can be isolated. This feature representation requires fewer parameters than spectrally based methods and so minimises overfitting. Following the tensor factorisation, the separated signals are reconstructed by learning appropriate Wiener-filter spectral parameters which have been constrained by activation parameters learned in the first stage. Strong results were obtained for two-speaker mixtures where source separation performance exceeded those used as benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed semi-supervised method outperformed both semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorisation and blind non-negative modulation spectrum tensor factorisation.",

title     = "Group Delay Function from All-Pole Models for Musical Instrument Recognition",
abstract  = "In this work, the feature based on the group delay function from all-pole models (APGD) is proposed for pitched musical instrument recognition. Conventionally, the spectrum-related features take into account merely the magnitude information, whereas the phase is often overlooked due to the complications related to its interpretation. However, there is often additional information concealed in the phase, which could be beneficial for recognition. The APGD is an elegant approach to inferring phase information, which lacks of the issues related to interpreting the phase and does not require extensive parameter adjustment. Having shown applicability for speech-related problems, it is now explored in terms of instrument recognition. The evaluation is performed with various instrument sets and shows noteworthy absolute accuracy gains of up to 7\% compared to the baseline mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) case. Combined with the MFCCs and with feature selection, APGD demonstrates superiority over the baseline with all the evaluated sets.",

title     = "Context-dependent sound event detection",
abstract  = "The work presented in this article studies how the context information can be used in the automatic sound event detection process, and how the detection system can benefit from such information. Humans are using context information to make more accurate predictions about the sound events and ruling out unlikely events given the context. We propose a similar utilization of context information in the automatic sound event detection process. The proposed approach is composed of two stages: automatic context recognition stage and sound event detection stage. Contexts are modeled using Gaussian mixture models and sound events are modeled using three-state left-to-right hidden Markov models. In the first stage, audio context of the tested signal is recognized. Based on the recognized context, a context-specific set of sound event classes is selected for the sound event detection stage. The event detection stage also uses context-dependent acoustic models and count-based event priors. Two alternative event detection approaches are studied. In the first one, a monophonic event sequence is outputted by detecting the most prominent sound event at each time instance using Viterbi decoding. The second approach introduces a new method for producing polyphonic event sequence by detecting multiple overlapping sound events using multiple restricted Viterbi passes. A new metric is introduced to evaluate the sound event detection performance with various level of polyphony. This combines the detection accuracy and coarse time-resolution error into one metric, making the comparison of the performance of detection algorithms simpler. The two-step approach was found to improve the results substantially compared to the context-independent baseline system. In the block-level, the detection accuracy can be almost doubled by using the proposed context-dependent event detection.",

title     = "Acoustic Source Localization in a Room Environment and at Moderate Distances",
abstract  = "The pressure changes of an acoustic wavefront are sensed with a microphone that acts as a transducer, converting sound pressure into voltage. The voltage is then converted into digital form with an analog to digital (AD) -converter to provide a discrete time quantized digital signal. This thesis discusses methods to estimate the location of a sound source from the signals of multiple microphones. Acoustic source localization (ASL) can be used to locate talkers, which is useful for speech communication systems such as teleconferencing and hearing aids. Active localization methods receive and send energy, whereas passive methods only receive energy. The discussed ASL methods are passive which makes them attractive for surveillance applications, such as localization of vehicles and monitoring of areas. This thesis focuses on ASL in a room environment and at moderate distances that are often present in outdoor applications. The frequency range of many commonly occurring sounds such as speech, vehicles, and jet aircraft is large. Time delay estimation (TDE) methods are suitable for estimating properties from such wideband signals. Since TDE methods have been extensively studied, the theory is attractive to apply in localization. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) -based methods estimate the source location from measured TDOA values between microphones. These methods are computationally attractive but deteriorate rapidly when the TDOA estimates are no longer directly related to the source position. In a room environment such conditions could be faced when reverberation or noise starts to dominate TDOA estimation. The combination of microphone pairwise TDE measurements is studied as a more robust localization solution. TDE measurements are combined into a spatial likelihood function (SLF) of source position. A sequential Bayesian method known as particle filtering (PF) is used to estimate the source position. The PF based localization accuracy increases when the variance of SLF decreases. Results from simulations and real-data show that multiplication (intersection operation) results in a SLF with smaller variance than the typically applied summation (union operation). The above localization methods assume that the source is located in the near-field of the microphone array, i.e., the source emitted wavefront curvature is observable. In the far-field, the source wavefront is assumed planar and localization is considered by using spatially separated direction observations. The direction of arrival (DOA) of a source emitted wavefront impinging on a microphone array is traditionally estimated by steering the array to a direction that maximizes the steered response power. Such estimates can be deteriorated by noise and reverberation. Therefore, talker localization is considered using DOA discrimination. The sound propagation delay from the source to the microphone array becomes significant at moderate distances. As a result, the directional observations from a moving sound source point behind the true source position. Omitting the propagation delay results in a biased location estimate of a moving or discontinuously emitting source. To solve this problem the propagation delay is proposed to be modeled in the estimation process. Motivated by the robustness of localization using the combination of TDE measurements, source localization by directly combining the TDE-based array steered responses is considered. This extends the near-field talker localization methods to far-field source localization. The presented propagation delay modeling is then proposed for the steered response localization. The improvement in localization accuracy by including the propagation delay is studied using a simulated moving sound source in the atmosphere. The presented indoor localization methods have been evaluated in the Classification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) 2006 and CLEAR'07 technology evaluations. In the evaluations, the performance of the proposed ASL methods was evaluated by a third party from several hours of annotated data. The data was gathered from meetings held in multiple smart rooms. According to the obtained results from CLEAR'07 development dataset (166 min) presented in this thesis, 92 \% of speech activity in a meeting situation was located within 17 cm accuracy.",

Estimation of sound wave direction of arrival (DOA) based on time differences between separate microphones is typically applied for sound source localization, and the existing research achievements of the field are utilized in the presented study. In this paper, a new method for estimating the state of a supersonic bullet is proposed. State is defined here to consist of bullet{\textquoteright}s trajectory, caliber, and speed. The method is based on a mathematical modeling of the bullet shock wave, and the parameter estimation procedure is built over the Bayesian inference. Both simulations and real shooting data are used to test and verify the performance of the proposed method. Bringing shock wave modeling and Bayesian inference together is the main focus of the study.",

title     = "Detection of artifacts in monitored trends in intensive care",
abstract  = "In intensive care, decision-making is often based on trend analysis of physiological parameters. Artifact detection is a pre-requisite for interpretation of trends both for clinical and research purposes. In this study, we developed and tested three methods of artifact detection in physiological data (systolic, mean and diastolic artery and pulmonary artery pressures, central venous pressure, and peripheral temperature) using pre-filtered physiological signals (2-min median filtering) from 41 patients after cardiac surgery. These methods were: (1) the Rosner statistic; (2) slope detection with rules; and (3) comparison with a running median (median detection). After tuning the methods using data from 20 randomly chosen patients, the methods were tested using the data from the remaining patients. The results were compared with those obtained by manual identification of artifacts by three senior intensive care unit physicians. Out of an average of 22 480 data points for each variable, the three observers labelled 0.98\% (220 data points) as artifacts. The inter-observer agreement was good. The average (range) sensitivity for artifact detection in all variables in the test database was 66\% (33-92\%) for the Rosner statistic, 64\% (24-98\%) for slope detection and 72\% (41-98\%) for median detection. All methods had a high specificity (greater than or equal to 94\%). Slope detection had the highest mean positive prediction rate (53\%; 21-85\%). When the performance was measured by the cost function, slope detection and running median performed equally well and were superior to Rosner statistics for systemic arterial and central venous pressure and peripheral temperature. None of the methods produced acceptable results for pulmonary artery pressures. We conclude that median filtering of physiological variables is effective in removing artifacts. In post-operative cardiac surgery patients, the remaining artifacts are difficult to detect among physiological and pathophysiological changes. This makes large databases for tuning artifact algorithms mandatory. Despite these limitations, the performance of running median and slope detection were good in selected physiological variables.
