    abstract = "This chapter explains the basic concepts in computational methods used for analysis of sound scenes and events. Even though the analysis tasks in many applications seem different, the underlying computational methods are typically based on the same principles. We explain the commonalities between analysis tasks such as sound event detection, sound scene classification, or audio tagging. We focus on the machine learning approach, where the sound categories (i.e., classes) to be analyzed are defined in advance. We explain the typical components of an analysis system, including signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and pattern classification. We also preset an example system based on multi-label deep neural networks, which has been found to be applicable in many analysis tasks discussed in this book. Finally, we explain the whole processing chain that involves developing computational audio analysis systems. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2018. All rights reserved.",

    title = "Computational Insights to Acquisition of Phonemes, Words, and Word Meanings in Early Language: Sequential or Parallel Acquisition?",
    abstract = "Previous computational models of early language acquisition have shown how linguistic structure of speech can be acquired using auditory or audiovisual learning mechanisms. However, real infants have sustained access to both uni- and multimodal sensory experiences. Therefore, it is of interest how the uni- and multimodal learning mechanisms could operate in concert, and how their interplay might affect the acquisition dynamics of different linguistic representations. This paper explores these questions with a computational model capable of simultaneous auditory and audiovisual learning from speech and images. We study how the model{\textquoteright}s latent representations reflect phonemic, lexical, and semantic knowledge as a function of language experience. We also test how the findings vary with differential emphasis on the two learning mechanisms. As a result, we find phonemic learning always starting to emerge before lexical learning, followed by semantics. However, there is also notable overlap in their development. The same pattern emerges irrespectively of the emphasis on auditory or audiovisual learning. The result illustrates how the acquisition dynamics of linguistic representations are decoupled from the primary learning objectives (mechanisms) of the learner, and how the emergence of phonemes and words can be facilitated by both auditory and audiovisual learning in a synergetic manner.",

The dominant feature representations (in particular, log-mel spectra and raw waveform) and deep learning models are reviewed, including convolutional neural networks, variants of the long short-term memory architecture, as well as more audio-specific neural network models. Subsequently, prominent deep learning application areas are covered, i.e., audio recognition (automatic speech recognition, music information retrieval, environmental sound detection, localization and tracking) and synthesis and transformation (source separation, audio enhancement, generative models for speech, sound, and music synthesis). Finally, key issues and future questions regarding deep learning applied to audio signal processing are identified.",

The spectral representations are then used to derive time-frequency masks. In this work we introduce a method to directly learn time-frequency masks from an observed mixture magnitude spectrum. We employ recurrent neural networks and train them using prior knowledge only for the magnitude spectrum of the target source. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we focus on the task of singing voice separation. The results from an objective evaluation show that our proposed method provides comparable results to deep learning based methods which operate over complicated signal representations. Compared to previous methods that approximate time-frequency masks, our method has increased performance of signal to distortion ratio by an average of 3.8 dB.",

    abstract = "For real-time or close to real-time applications, sound source separation can be performed on-line, where new frames of incoming data for a mixture signal are processed as they arrive, at very low delay. We propose an approach which generates the separation filters for short synthesis frames to achieve low latency source separation, based on a compositional model mixture of the audio to be separated. Filter parameters are derived from a longer temporal context than the current processing frame through use of a longer analysis frame. A pair of dictionaries are used, one for analysis and one for reconstruction. With this approach we are able to increase separation performance at low latencies whilst retaining the low-latency provided by the use of short synthesis frames. The proposed data handling scheme and parameters can be adjusted to achieve real-time performance, given sufficient computational power. Low-latency output allows a human listener to use the results of such a separation scheme directly, without a perceptible delay. With the proposed method, separated source-to-distortion ratios (SDRs) can be improved by over 1 dB for latencies below 20 ms, without any affect on latency.",

An automated detection and quantification of infant C/H is particularly needed in long term at-home studies where development of infants{\textquoteright} neurobehavior is measured using wearable devices. Here, we first developed a phenomenological categorization for physical infant-caregiver interactions to support five different definitions of C/H behaviors. Then, we trained and assessed deep learning-based classifiers for their automatic detection from multi-sensor wearable recordings that were originally used for mobile assessment of infants{\textquoteright} motor development. Our results show that an automated C/H detection is feasible at few-second temporal accuracy. With the best C/H definition, the automated detector shows 96\\% accuracy and 0.56 kappa, which is slightly less than the video-based inter-rater agreement between trained human experts (98\\% accuracy, 0.77 kappa). The classifier performance varies with C/H definition reflecting the extent to which infants{\textquoteright} movements are present in each C/H variant. A systematic benchmarking experiment shows that the widely used actigraphy-based method ignores the normally occurring C/H behaviors. Finally, we show proof-of-concept for the utility of the novel classifier in studying C/H behavior across infant development. Particularly, we show that matching the C/H detections to individuals{\textquoteright} gross motor ability discloses novel insights to infant-parent interaction.",

The research is planned to span over a four year period, during which a corpus (dataset) of emotional Finnish speech will be collected, analyzed, and processed for modelling purposes. Based on this data, a speech emotion classifier for conversational Finnish will be developed and later further improved to enable the study and automatic recognition of idiolectical variation of affect expression. Results of the project can be used for improved affective AI systems that are able to understand the richness of human emotions in spoken communication in various circumstances by various speakers and listeners.",

    abstract = "Exemplar-based speech enhancement systems work by decomposing the noisy speech as a weighted sum of speech and noise exemplars stored in a dictionary and use the resulting speech and noise estimates to obtain a time-varying filter in the full-resolution frequency domain to enhance the noisy speech. To obtain the decomposition, exemplars sampled in lower dimensional spaces are preferred over the full-resolution frequency domain for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize to unseen cases. But the resulting filter may be sub-optimal as the mapping of the obtained speech and noise estimates to the full-resolution frequency domain yields a low-rank approximation. This paper proposes an efficient way to directly compute the full-resolution frequency estimates of speech and noise using coupled dictionaries: an input dictionary containing atoms from the desired exemplar space to obtain the decomposition and a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars from the full-resolution frequency domain. We also introduce modulation spectrogram features for the exemplar-based tasks using this approach. The proposed system was evaluated for various choices of input exemplars and yielded improved speech enhancement performances on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 databases. We further show that the proposed approach also results in improved word error rates (WERs) for the speech recognition tasks using HMM-GMM and deep-neural network (DNN) based systems.",

In this work we propose a method for learning audio representations using an audio autoencoder (AAE), a general word embed-dings model (WEM), and a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism. MHA attends on the output of the WEM, pro-viding a contextualized representation of the tags associated with the audio, and we align the output of MHA with the out-put of the encoder of AAE using a contrastive loss. We jointly optimize AAE and MHA and we evaluate the audio representations (i.e. the output of the encoder of AAE) by utilizing them in three different downstream tasks, namely sound, music genre, and music instrument classification. Our results show that employing multi-head self-attention with multiple heads in the tag-based network can induce better learned audio representations.",

The proposed system analyzes an initially unlabeled audio dataset, from which it selects sound segments for manual annotation. The candidate segments are generated based on a proposed change point detection approach, and the selection is based on the principle of mismatch-first farthest-traversal. During the training of SED models, recordings are used as training inputs, preserving the long-term context for annotated segments. The proposed system clearly outperforms reference methods in the two datasets used for evaluation (TUT Rare Sound 2017 and TAU Spatial Sound 2019). Training with recordings as context outperforms training with only annotated segments. Mismatch-first farthest-traversal outperforms reference sample selection methods based on random sampling and uncertainty sampling. Remarkably, the required annotation effort can be greatly reduced on the dataset where target sound events are rare: by annotating only 2\\% of the training data, the achieved SED performance is similar to annotating all the training data.",

We demonstrate that a nearly identical model architecture (HuBERT) trained with a masked language modeling loss does not exhibit this same ability, suggesting that the visual grounding objective is responsible for the emergence of this phenomenon. We propose the use of a minimum cut algorithm to automatically predict syllable boundaries in speech, followed by a 2-stage clustering method to group identical syllables together. We show that our model not only outperforms a state-of-the-art syllabic segmentation method on the language it was trained on (English), but also generalizes in a zero-shot fashion to Estonian. Finally, we show that the same model is capable of zero-shot generalization for a word segmentation task on 4 other languages from the Zerospeech Challenge, in some cases beating the previous state-of-the-art.",

    abstract = "The performance of discriminative machine-learning classifiers, such as neural networks, is limited by training label inconsistencies. Even expert-based annotations can suffer from label inconsistencies, especially in the case of ambiguous phenomena-to-annotate. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, iterative annotation refinement (IAR) 2.0, for refining inconsistent annotations for time-series data. IAR 2.0 uses a procedure that utilizes discriminative classifiers to iteratively combine original annotations with increasingly accurate posterior estimates of classes present in the data. Unlike most existing label refinement approaches, IAR 2.0 offers a simpler yet effective solution for resolving ambiguities in training labels, working with real label noise on time-series data instead of synthetic label noise on image data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through five distinct classification tasks on two highly distinct data modalities. As a result, we show that the labels produced by IAR 2.0 systematically improve classifier performance compared to using the original labels or a previous state-of-the-art method for label refinement. We also conduct a set of controlled simulations to systematically investigate when IAR 2.0 fails to improve on the original training labels. The simulation results demonstrate that IAR 2.0 improves performance in nearly all tested conditions. We also find that the decrease in performance when IAR 2.0 fails is small compared to the average performance gain when IAR 2.0 succeeds, encouraging the use of IAR 2.0 even when the nature of data is unknown.

At signal-to-noise ratios below 0 dB, a majority of features may become corrupted, severely degrading the performance of classifiers built upon clean observations of a target class. As the energy and complexity of competing sources increase, their explicit modelling becomes integral for successful detection and classification of target speech. We have previously demonstrated how non-negative compositional modelling in a spectrogram space is suitable for robust recognition of speech and speakers even at low SNRs. In this work, the sparse coding approach is extended to cover the whole separation and classification chain to recognise the speaker of short utterances in difficult noise environments. A convolutive matrix factorisation and coding system is evaluated on 2nd CHiME Track 1 data. Over 98\\% average speaker recognition accuracy is achieved for shorter than three second utterances at +9 … -6 dB SNR, illustrating the system's performance in challenging conditions.",

    abstract = "Child-directed speech (CDS) is a particular type of speech that adults use when addressing young children. Its properties also change as a function of extralinguistic factors, such as age of the child being addressed. Access to large amounts of representative and varied CDS would be useful for child language research, as this would enable controlled computational modeling experiments of infant language acquisition with realistic input in terms of quality and quantity. In this study, we describe an approach to model age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS using a language model (LM) trained on CDS transcripts and ages of the recipient children, as obtained from North American English corpora of the CHILDES database. The created LM can then be used to stochastically generate synthetic CDS transcripts in an age-appropriate manner, thereby scaling beyond the original datasets in size. We compare characteristics of the generated CDS against the real speech addressed at children of different ages, showing that the LM manages to capture age-dependent changes in CDS, except for a slight difference in the effective vocabulary size. As a side product, we also provide a systematic characterization of age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS in CHILDES, illustrating how all measured aspects of the CDS change with children's age.",

    abstract = "This paper introduces AVCaps, an audio-visual dataset that contains separate textual captions for the audio, visual, and audio-visual contents of video clips. The dataset contains 2061 video clips constituting a total of 28.8 hours. We provide up to 5 captions for the audio, visual, and audio-visual content of each clip, crowdsourced separately. Existing datasets focus on a single modality or do not provide modality-specific captions, limiting the study of how each modality contributes to overall comprehension in multimodal settings. Our dataset addresses this critical gap in multimodal research by offering a resource for studying how audio and visual content are captioned individually, as well as how audio-visual content is captioned in relation to these individual modalities. Crowdsourced audio-visual captions are prone to favor visual content over audio content. To avoid this we use large language models (LLMs) to generate three balanced audio-visual captions for each clip based on the crowdsourced captions. We present captioning and retrieval experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of modality-specific captions in evaluating model performance. Specifically, we show that the modality-specific captions allow us to quantitatively assess how well a model understands audio and visual information from a given video. Notably, we find that a model trained on the balanced LLM-generated audio-visual captions captures audio information more effectively compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions. This model achieves a 14\\% higher Sentence-BERT similarity on crowdsourced audio captions compared to a model trained on crowdsourced audio-visual captions, which are typically more biased towards visual information. We also discuss the possibilities in multimodal representation learning, question answering, developing new video captioning metrics, and generative AI that this dataset unlocks. The dataset is available publicly at Zenodo and Hugging Face.",

    abstract = {We are largely used to hearing explanations. For example, if someone thinks you are sad today, they might reply to your {"}why?{"}with {"}because you were so Hmmmmm-mmm-mmm{"}. Today's Artificial Intelligence (AI), however, is - if at all - largely providing explanations of decisions in a visual or textual manner. While such approaches are good for communication via visual media such as in research papers or screens of intelligent devices, they may not always be the best way to explain; especially when the end user is not an expert. In particular, when the AI's task is about Audio Intelligence, visual explanations appear less intuitive than audible, sonified ones. Sonification has also great potential for explainable AI (XAI) in systems that deal with non-audio data - for example, because it does not require visual contact or active attention of a user. Hence, sonified explanations of AI decisions face a challenging, yet highly promising and pioneering task. That involves incorporating innovative XAI algorithms to allow pointing back at the learning data responsible for decisions made by an AI, and to include decomposition of the data to identify salient aspects. It further aims to identify the components of the preprocessing, feature representation, and learnt attention patterns that are responsible for the decisions. Finally, it targets decision-making at the model-level, to provide a holistic explanation of the chain of processing in typical pattern recognition problems from end-to-end. Sonified AI explanations will need to unite methods for sonification of the identified aspects that benefit decisions, decomposition and recomposition of audio to sonify which parts in the audio were responsible for the decision, and rendering attention patterns and salient feature representations audible. Benchmarking sonified XAI is challenging, as it will require a comparison against a backdrop of existing, state-of-the-art visual and textual alternatives, as well as synergistic complementation of all modalities in user evaluations. Sonified AI explanations will need to target different user groups to allow personalisation of the sonification experience for different user needs, to lead to a major breakthrough in comprehensibility of AI via hearing how decisions are made, hence supporting tomorrow's humane AI's trustability. Here, we introduce and motivate the general idea, and provide accompanying considerations including milestones of realisation of sonifed XAI and foreseeable risks.},

For the problems which lack data sufficient to achieve high performance, methods for transfer learning can be applied. These refer to performing the new task while having prior knowledge of the nature of the data, gained by first performing a different task, for which training data is abundant. Shown successful for other machine learning tasks, transfer learning is now investigated in audio analysis. We propose to solve the weakly labelled problem of sound event tagging with small amounts of training data by transferring the abstract knowledge about the nature of audio data from another tagging task. The proposed methods constitute pre-Training of a recurrent neural network or its parts to perform one tagging task given abundant and diverse training data, and then using it or its parts for a new task of tagging sound events of different nature, for which the data is limited. Several architectures for such transfer are proposed and evaluated, showing impressive classification accuracy of 83.4\\% with gains of up to 20 percentage points over the baseline given as little as 36 training samples for the target task.",

    abstract = "State-of-the-art methods for monaural singing voice separation consist in estimating the magnitude spectrum of the voice in the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) domain by means of deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting magnitude estimate is then combined with the mixture's phase to retrieve the complex-valued STFT of the voice, which is further synthesized into a time-domain signal. However, when the sources overlap in time and frequency, the STFT phase of the voice differs from the mixture's phase, which results in interference and artifacts in the estimated signals. In this paper, we investigate on recent phase recovery algorithms that tackle this issue and can further enhance the separation quality. These algorithms exploit phase constraints that originate from a sinusoidal model or from consistency , a property that is a direct consequence of the STFT redundancy. Experiments conducted on real music songs show that those algorithms are efficient for reducing interference in the estimated voice compared to the baseline approach.",

The chapter discusses two main scenarios such as parameterization of multichannel surround sound and parameterization of microphone array signals. It explains the principles of source separation by time-frequency filtering using separation masks constructed from the spectrogram models. The chapter introduces a spatial covariance matrix model based on the directions of arrival of sound events and spectral templates, and discusses its relationship to conventional spatial audio signal processing. Source separation using spectrogram factorization models is achieved via time- frequency filtering of the original observation short-time Fourier transform (STFT) by a generalized Wiener filter obtained from the spectrogram model parameters.",

The creation of a dataset for this task requires a considerable amount of work, rendering the crowdsourcing a very attractive option. In this paper we present a three steps based framework for crowdsourcing an audio captioning dataset, based on concepts and practises followed for the creation of widely used image captioning and machine translations datasets. During the first step initial captions are gathered. A grammatically corrected and/or rephrased version of each initial caption is obtained in second step. Finally, the initial and edited captions are rated, keeping the top ones for the produced dataset. We objectively evaluate the impact of our framework during the process of creating an audio captioning dataset, in terms of diversity and amount of typographical errors in the obtained captions. The obtained results show that the resulting dataset has less typographical errors than the initial captions, and on average each sound in the produced dataset has captions with a Jaccard similarity of 0.24, roughly equivalent to two ten-word captions having in common four words with the same root, indicating that the captions are dissimilar while they still contain some of the same information.},

CNNs and RNNs as classifiers have recently shown improved performances over established methods in various sound recognition tasks. We combine these two approaches in a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and apply it on a polyphonic sound event detection task. We compare the performance of the proposed CRNN method with CNN, RNN, and other established methods, and observe a considerable improvement for four different datasets consisting of everyday sound events.",

    abstract = "It has been suggested that early cry parameters are connected to later cognitive abilities. The present study is the first to investigate whether the acoustic features of infant cry are associated with cognitive development already during the first year, as measured by oculomotor orienting and attention disengagement. Cry sounds for acoustic analyses (fundamental frequency; F0) were recorded in two neonatal cohorts at the age of 0–8 days (Tampere, Finland) or at 6 weeks (Cape Town, South Africa). Eye tracking was used to measure oculomotor orienting to peripheral visual stimuli and attention disengagement from central stimuli at 8 months (Tampere) or at 6 months (Cape Town) of age. Only a marginal positive correlation between fundamental frequency of cry (F0) and visual attention disengagement was observed in the Tampere cohort, but not in the Cape Town cohort. This correlation indicated that infants from the Tampere cohort with a higher neonatal F0 were marginally slower to shift their gaze away from the central stimulus to the peripheral stimulus. No associations between F0 and oculomotor orienting were observed in either cohort. We discuss possible factors influencing the current pattern of results suggesting a lack of replicable associations between neonatal cry and visual attention and suggest directions for future research investigating the potential of early cry analysis in predicting later cognitive development.",

In many cases the masking process is not a learnable function or is not encapsulated into the deep learning optimization. Consequently, most of the existing methods rely on a post processing step using the generalized Wiener filtering. This work proposes a method that learns and optimizes (during training) a source-dependent mask and does not need the aforementioned post processing step. We introduce a recurrent inference algorithm, a sparse transformation step to improve the mask generation process, and a learned denoising filter. Obtained results show an increase of 0.49 dB for the signal to distortion ratio and 0.30 dB for the signal to interference ratio, compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for monaural singing voice separation.",

We focus on applications where low algorithmic latency (≤ 10 ms) is important. We use long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and evaluate our proposed approach on four sets of two-speaker mixtures from extended Danish hearing in noise (HINT) dataset. We show that the proposed loss function can offer improved or at par objective intelligibility (in terms of ESTOI) compared to an MSE optimized baseline while resulting in lower objective separation performance (in terms of the source to distortion ratio (SDR)). We then proceed to propose an approach where the network is first initialized with weights optimized for MSE criterion and then trained with the proposed ESTOI loss criterion. This approach mitigates some of the losses in objective separation performance while preserving the gains in objective intelligibility.",

    abstract = "The work presented in this article studies how the context information can be used in the automatic sound event detection process, and how the detection system can benefit from such information. Humans are using context information to make more accurate predictions about the sound events and ruling out unlikely events given the context. We propose a similar utilization of context information in the automatic sound event detection process. The proposed approach is composed of two stages: automatic context recognition stage and sound event detection stage. Contexts are modeled using Gaussian mixture models and sound events are modeled using three-state left-to-right hidden Markov models. In the first stage, audio context of the tested signal is recognized. Based on the recognized context, a context-specific set of sound event classes is selected for the sound event detection stage. The event detection stage also uses context-dependent acoustic models and count-based event priors. Two alternative event detection approaches are studied. In the first one, a monophonic event sequence is outputted by detecting the most prominent sound event at each time instance using Viterbi decoding. The second approach introduces a new method for producing polyphonic event sequence by detecting multiple overlapping sound events using multiple restricted Viterbi passes. A new metric is introduced to evaluate the sound event detection performance with various level of polyphony. This combines the detection accuracy and coarse time-resolution error into one metric, making the comparison of the performance of detection algorithms simpler. The two-step approach was found to improve the results substantially compared to the context-independent baseline system. In the block-level, the detection accuracy can be almost doubled by using the proposed context-dependent event detection.",

They operate on sequences of acoustic features, extracted from consecutive frames of an audio recording of a word utterance. The proposed architecture includes a convolutional neural network, a recurrent neural network, or a combination of the two. The optimal topology and hyperpa-rameters are obtained in a Bayesian optimisation setting using a tree-structured Parzen estimator. A dataset of 80 words uttered naturally by 120 speakers is collected. The performance of the proposed system, evaluated on a well-represented subset of the dataset, shows that it is capable of detecting pronunciation errors in most of the words (46/49) with high accuracy (mean accuracy gain over the zero rule 12.21 percent points).",

    abstract = "Voice activity detection (VAD) aims for detecting the presence of speech in a given input signal, and is often the first step in voice -based applications such as speech communication systems. In the context of personal devices, own voice detection (OVD) is a sub-task of VAD, since it targets speech detection of the person wearing the device, while ignoring other speakers in the presence of interference signals. This article first summarizes recent single and multi-microphone, multi-sensor, and hearing aids related VAD techniques. Then, a wearable in-ear device equipped with multiple microphones and an accelerometer is investigated for the OVD task using a neural network with input embedding and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. The device picks up the user{\textquoteright}s speech signal through air as well as vibrations through the body. However, besides external sounds the device is sensitive to user{\textquoteright}s own non-speech vocal noises (e.g. coughing, yawning, etc.) and movement noise caused by physical activities. A signal mixing model is proposed to produce databases of noisy observations used for training and testing the frame-by-frame OVD method. The best model{\textquoteright}s performance is further studied in the presence of different recorded interference. An ablation study reports the model{\textquoteright}s performance on sub-sets of sensors. The results show that the OVD approach is robust towards both user motion and user generated vocal non-speech sounds in the presence of loud external interference. The approach is suitable for real-time operation and achieves 90-96 \\% OVD accuracy in challenging use scenarios with a short 10 ms processing frame length.",

    title = "Modeling Child Language Development using Naturalistic Data at a Scale",
    abstract = "These include learning of the language{\textquoteright}s phonetic units, segmentation of words from running speech, association word forms with their meanings, and acquisition of the syntax. Typical empirical research on child language development (CLD) consists of well-controlled focused studies conducted in laboratory conditions. In contrast, only a few high-level theories, like NLM-e (Kuhl et al., 2008) and PRIMIR (Werker \\& Curtin, 2005), have aimed to integrate the present understanding of CLD into unified frameworks. However, these frameworks have not gained unanimous acceptance in the field, largely since they are relatively abstract, and only qualitatively describe the mechanisms and representations that could be involved in CLD. As a result, we still have limited understanding of the basic mechanisms and their interactions driving early language acquisition. In principle, computational modelling of CLD is a potential solution to the so-called “integration problem” across empirical findings. This is because computational models can, and must, explicitly address all aspects of the information processing chain from input data to the resulting behavior. By formulating the theories as high-level computational goals and operations, implementing them as functional signal processing and machine learning algorithms, and finally exposing the models to realistic input data comparable to what real infants experience, ecological plausibility and validity of the underlying theories can be explicitly tested. However, the scientific impact of the existing modeling efforts has also been limited. Instead of addressing multiple aspects of language in one model, earlier models have usually focused on individual language phenomena (e.g., phonemic learning or word segmentation). Moreover, they have rarely investigated learning as a function of the developmental timeline of the learner. We argue that two main factors currently hinder the development of more comprehensive, ecologically valid, and thus influential models of CLD: 1) lack of ecologically valid and openly available large-scale speech data to simulate child language experiences at a realistic scale, where various adult speech corpora are currently used instead, and 2) limited validation of the models with respect to empirical data on real infant language learning, where the current standard approach is to evaluate the models against linguistic theory of how speech is formally structured. Without fixing the data and evaluation problems, it is difficult to develop models that could truly help us to understand the big picture of CLD. In this talk, we provide an overview of our ongoing “Modeling Child Language Development using Naturalistic Data at a Scale” (L-SCALE) project, where the aim is to enable development of more comprehensive and ecologically valid computational models of CLD. To achieve this, the L-SCALE project tackles the two challenges identified above: 1) solving the ecologically valid training data problem by creating a pipeline called Generator of Infant Language ExperienceS (GILES) for generation of ecologically relevant large-scale training data for computational models, and 2) solving the mismatch between human data and computational model evaluation by developing evaluation protocols that enable comparison of computational models against empirical data on CLD as a function of learner{\textquoteright}s age. We will also showcase some recent developments of the project, including a proof- of-concept demonstration of the GILES pipeline and a meta-analytic approach to compare models to empirical data on infant language learning. The L-SCALE project is funded by Kone Foundation (2022–2026).",

The strategy for negative sampling refers to selecting negatives (either audio clips or textual descriptions) from a pool of candidates for a positive audio-text pair. We explore sampling strategies via model-estimated within-modality and cross-modality relevance scores for audio and text samples. With a constant training setting on the retrieval system from [1], we study eight sampling strategies, including hard and semi-hard negative sampling. Experimental results show that retrieval performance varies dramatically among different strategies. Particularly, by selecting semi-hard negatives with cross-modality scores, the retrieval system gains improved performance in both text-to-audio and audio-to-text retrieval. Besides, we show that feature collapse occurs while sampling hard negatives with cross-modality scores.",

We propose to explore more exhaustively those algorithms, in particular the choice of the methodology (standard EM or SAGE variant) and the latent variable set (full or reduced). We then derive four EM-based algorithms, among which three are novel. Speech separation experiments show that one of those novel algorithms using a standard EM methodology and a reduced set of latent variables outperforms its SAGE variants and competes with the conventional multiplicative algorithm.",

In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present in detail each task and analyse the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.",

In contrast to typical methods known from the literature, which are based on the assumption that the desired signal dominates (for example GMM-UBM, joint factor analysis, i-vectors), compositional models such as NMD describe a recording as a non-negative combination of latent components. The proposed model represents a spectrogram of a signal as a sum of spectrotemporal patterns that span durations of order about 150 ms, while many state of the art automatic speaker recognition systems model a probability distribution of features extracted from much shorter excerpts of speech signal (about 50 ms). Longer patterns carry information about dynamical aspects of modeled signal, for example information about accent and articulation. We use a parametric dictionary in the NMD and the parameters of the dictionary carry information about the speakers{\textquoteright} identity. The experiments performed on the CHiME corpus show that with the proposed approach achieves equal error rate comparable to an i-vector based system.",

Some will describe the weather and features within it, others will use a holistic descriptor like {\textquoteleft}park{\textquoteright}, and others still will use unique identifiers such as cities or names. In this paper, we undertake the task of automatic city classification to ask whether we can recognize a city from a set of sound scenesƒ In this problem each city has recordings from multiple scenes. We test a series of methods for this novel task and show that a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve accuracy of 50\\%. This is less than the acoustic scene classification task baseline in the DCASE 2018 ASC challenge on the same data. A simple adaptation to the class labels of pairing city labels with grouped scenes, accuracy increases to 52\\%, closer to the simpler scene classification task. Finally we also formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework and achieve an accuracy of 56\\%, outperforming the aforementioned approaches.",

We simulated word learning in infants up to 12 months of age in a realistic setting, using a model that solely learns from statistical regularities in unannotated raw speech and pixel-level visual input. Crucially, the quantity of object naming events was carefully designed to match that accessible to infants of comparable ages. Results show that the model effectively learns to recognize words and associate them with corresponding visual objects, with a vocabulary growth rate comparable to that observed in infants. The findings support the viability of general statistical learning for early word perception, demonstrating how learning can operate without assuming any prior linguistic capabilities.",

We propose a novel multichannel NMF model with time-varying mixing of the sources denoted by spatial covariance matrices (SCM) and provide update equations for optimizing model parameters minimizing squared Frobenius norm. The SCMs of the model are obtained based on estimated directions of arrival of tracked sources at each time frame. The evaluation is based on established objective separation criteria and using real recordings of two and three simultaneous moving sound sources. The compared methods include conventional beamforming and ideal ratio mask separation. The proposed method is shown to exceed the separation quality of other evaluated blind approaches according to all measured quantities. Additionally, we evaluate the method's susceptibility towards tracking errors by comparing the separation quality achieved using annotated ground truth source trajectories.",

We show that fluctuations of hi-hat amplitudes and interbeat intervals (times between hits) have clear long-range correlations and short-range anticorrelations separated by a characteristic time scale. In addition, we detect subtle features in Porcaro's drumming such as small drifts in the 16th note pulse and non-trivial periodic two-bar patterns in both hi-hat amplitudes and intervals. Through this investigation we introduce a step towards statistical studies of the 20th and 21st century music recordings in the framework of complex systems.

The limitation is particularly in scenarios with large distributed microphone arrays with varying speaker-to-microphone distances or compact, highly directional microphone arrays where speaker or microphone positions change over time. Current mask-based methods often fix the reference channel during training, which makes it not possible to adaptively select the reference channel for optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an adaptive approach for selecting the optimal reference channel. Our method leverages a multi-channel masking-based scheme, where multiple masked signals are combined to generate a single-channel output signal. This enhanced signal is then used for loss calculation, while the reference clean speech is adjusted based on the highest scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR). The experimental results on the Spear challenge simulated dataset D4 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the conventional approach of using a fixed reference channel with single-channel masking.",

Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as the long short-term memories (LSTMs) or the gated recurrent units (GRUs), take a vector as their input and use another vector to store their state. However, this approach results in the information from all the sources being contained in a single ordered vector, which is not optimal for permutation-invariant problems such as multi-source tracking. In this paper, we present a new recurrent architecture that uses unordered sets to represent both its input and its state and that is invariant to the permutations of the input set and equivariant to the permutations of the state set. Hence, the information of every sound source is represented in an individual embedding and the new estimates are assigned to the tracked trajectories regardless of their order.",

    abstract = "This paper proposes a method for online estimation of time-varying room impulse responses (RIR) between multiple isolated sound sources and a far-field mixture. The algorithm is formulated as adaptive convolutive filtering in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. We use the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for estimating the filter parameters due to its fast convergence rate, which is required for modeling rapidly changing RIRs of moving sound sources. The proposed method allows separation of reverberated sources from the far-field mixture given that their close-field signals are available. The evaluation is based on measuring unmixing performance (removal of reverberated source) using objective separation criteria calculated between the ground truth recording of the preserved sources and the unmixing result obtained with the proposed algorithm. We compare online and offline formulations for the RIR estimation and also provide evaluation with blind source separation algorithm only operating on the mixture signal.",

    title = "Establishing the reliability of metrics extracted from long-form recordings using LENA and the ACLEW pipeline",
    abstract = "Long-form audio recordings are increasingly used to study individual variation, group differences, and many other topics in theoretical and applied fields of developmental science, particularly for the description of children{\textquoteright}s language input (typically speech from adults) and children{\textquoteright}s language output (ranging from babble to sentences). The proprietary LENA software has been available for over a decade, and with it, users have come to rely on derived metrics like adult word count (AWC) and child vocalization counts (CVC), which have also more recently been derived using an open-source alternative, the ACLEW pipeline. Yet, there is relatively little work assessing the reliability of long-form metrics in terms of the stability of individual differences across time. Filling this gap, we analyzed eight spoken-language datasets: four from North American English-learning infants, and one each from British English-, French-, American English-/Spanish-, and Quechua-/Spanish-learning infants. The audio data were analyzed using two types of processing software: LENA and the ACLEW open-source pipeline. When all corpora were included, we found relatively low to moderate reliability (across multiple recordings, intraclass correlation coefficient attributed to the child identity [Child ICC], was < 50\\% for most metrics). There were few differences between the two pipelines. Exploratory analyses suggested some differences as a function of child age and corpora. These findings suggest that, while reliability is likely sufficient for various group-level analyses, caution is needed when using either LENA or ACLEW tools to study individual variation. We also encourage improvement of extant tools, specifically targeting accurate measurement of individual variation.",

    title = "Detection of artifacts in monitored trends in intensive care",
    abstract = "In intensive care, decision-making is often based on trend analysis of physiological parameters. Artifact detection is a pre-requisite for interpretation of trends both for clinical and research purposes. In this study, we developed and tested three methods of artifact detection in physiological data (systolic, mean and diastolic artery and pulmonary artery pressures, central venous pressure, and peripheral temperature) using pre-filtered physiological signals (2-min median filtering) from 41 patients after cardiac surgery. These methods were: (1) the Rosner statistic; (2) slope detection with rules; and (3) comparison with a running median (median detection). After tuning the methods using data from 20 randomly chosen patients, the methods were tested using the data from the remaining patients. The results were compared with those obtained by manual identification of artifacts by three senior intensive care unit physicians. Out of an average of 22 480 data points for each variable, the three observers labelled 0.98\\% (220 data points) as artifacts. The inter-observer agreement was good. The average (range) sensitivity for artifact detection in all variables in the test database was 66\\% (33-92\\%) for the Rosner statistic, 64\\% (24-98\\%) for slope detection and 72\\% (41-98\\%) for median detection. All methods had a high specificity (greater than or equal to 94\\%). Slope detection had the highest mean positive prediction rate (53\\%; 21-85\\%). When the performance was measured by the cost function, slope detection and running median performed equally well and were superior to Rosner statistics for systemic arterial and central venous pressure and peripheral temperature. None of the methods produced acceptable results for pulmonary artery pressures. We conclude that median filtering of physiological variables is effective in removing artifacts. In post-operative cardiac surgery patients, the remaining artifacts are difficult to detect among physiological and pathophysiological changes. This makes large databases for tuning artifact algorithms mandatory. Despite these limitations, the performance of running median and slope detection were good in selected physiological variables.

We build the combined detector as a Boolean function of thresholded detector scores and implement it as a binary classification cascade. The cascade structure is computationally efficient by providing the possibility to early termination. For the proposed Boolean combination function, the computational load of classification is reduced whenever the function becomes determinate before all the component detectors have been utilized. We also propose an algorithm, which selects all the needed thresholds for the component detectors within the proposed Boolean combination. We present results on two audio-visual datasets, which prove the efficiency of the proposed combination framework. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially reduced computation time in laughter detection task, and our algorithm finds better thresholds for the component detectors within the Boolean combination than the other algorithms found in the literature.",

MaD TwinNet is a deep learning architecture that has reached state-of-the-art results in monaural singing voice separation. Herein, we propose to apply it to HPSS by using it to estimate the magnitude spectrogram of the percussive source. Then, we retrieve the complex-valued short-term Fourier transform of the sources by means of a phase recovery algorithm, which minimizes the reconstruction error and enforces the phase of the harmonic part to follow a sinusoidal phase model. Experiments conducted on realistic music mixtures show that this novel separation system outperforms the previous state-of-the art kernel additive model approach.",

    abstract = "Imprecise vowel articulation can be observed in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Acoustic features measuring vowel articulation have been demonstrated to be effective indicators of PD in its assessment. Standard clinical vowel articulation features of vowel working space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formants centralization ratio (FCR), are derived the first two formants of the three corner vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/. Conventionally, manual annotation of the corner vowels from speech data is required before measuring vowel articulation. This process is time-consuming. The present work aims to reduce human effort in clinical analysis of PD speech by proposing an automatic pipeline for vowel articulation assessment. The method is based on automatic corner vowel detection using a language universal phoneme recognizer, followed by statistical analysis of the formant data. The approach removes the restrictions of prior knowledge of speaking content and the language in question. Experimental results on a Finnish PD speech corpus demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed automatic method in deriving VAI, VSA, FCR and F2i/F2u (the second formant ratio for vowels /i/ and /u/). The automatically computed parameters are shown to be highly correlated with features computed with manual annotations of corner vowels. In addition, automatically and manually computed vowel articulation features have comparable correlations with experts' ratings on speech intelligibility, voice impairment and overall severity of communication disorder. Language-independence of the proposed approach is further validated on a Spanish PD database, PC-GITA, as well as on TORGO corpus of English dysarthric speech.",

    abstract = "In order to study how early emotional experiences shape infant development, one approach is to analyze the emotional content of speech heard by infants, as captured by child-centered daylong recordings, and as analyzed by automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) systems. However, since large-scale daylong audio is initially unannotated and differs from typical speech corpora from controlled environments, there are no existing in-domain SER systems for the task. Based on existing literature, it is also unclear what is the best approach to deploy a SER system for a new domain. Consequently, in this study, we investigated alternative strategies for deploying a SER system for large-scale child-centered audio recordings from a neonatal hospital environment, comparing cross-corpus generalization, active learning (AL), and domain adaptation (DA) methods in the process. We first conducted simulations with existing emotion-labeled speech corpora to find the best strategy for SER system deployment. We then tested how the findings generalize to our new initially unannotated dataset. As a result, we found that the studied AL method provided overall the most consistent results, being less dependent on the specifics of the training corpora or speech features compared to the alternative methods. However, in situations without the possibility to annotate data, unsupervised DA proved to be the best approach. We also observed that deployment of a SER system for real-world daylong child-centered audio recordings achieved a SER performance level comparable to those reported in literature, and that the amount of human effort required for the system deployment was overall relatively modest.",

Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose FMs for audio.

However, previous studies on sound classification are commonly based on cross-validation using a single dataset, without considering the cases that training and testing data are recorded in mismatched condition. Experiments revealed a big difference between homogeneous recognition scenario and heterogeneous recognition scenario, using a new dataset TUT-vocal-2016. In the homogeneous recognition scenario, the classification accuracy using cross-validation on TUT-vocal-2016 was 95.5\\%. In heterogeneous recognition scenario, seven existing datasets were used as training material and TUT-vocal-2016 was used for testing, the classification accuracy was only 69.6\\%. Several feature normalization methods were tested to improve the performance in heterogeneous recognition scenario. The best performance (96.8\\%) was obtained using the proposed subdataset-wise normalization.",

Commonly, the quality of the signals is enhanced applying delay and sum beamforming (or variants) to a microphone array. However, under particular conditions, the multi-path acoustic propagation leading to reverberation is not completely detrimental and can be used in a constructive way. In this direction, mirrored (virtual) microphones have been successfully applied in various research areas. In addition, the majority of naturally occurring sound sources, such as the human speaker, presents a certain degree of radiation directivity, which, coupled with data-independent beamforming, has been shown to slightly increase the captured speech quality. Building upon the concepts of environment awareness and the acoustic rake receiver, this paper investigates the use of mirrored microphones, associated to isolated and strong reflections, in combination with source directivity, to further improve the captured speech quality. Real-data gathered with a linear nested array, as well as simulated data, are used to test the proposed scheme, showing superior performance with respect to similar state of the art solutions.",

    abstract = "Automatic estimation of domestic activities from audio can be used to solve many problems, such as reducing the labor cost for nursing the elderly people. This study focuses on solving the problem of domestic activity clustering from audio. The target of domestic activity clustering is to cluster audio clips which belong to the same category of domestic activity into one cluster in an unsupervised way. In this paper, we propose a method of domestic activity clustering using a depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder network. In the proposed method, initial embeddings are learned by the depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder, and a clustering-oriented loss is designed to jointly optimize embedding refinement and cluster assignment. Different methods are evaluated on a public dataset (a derivative of the SINS dataset) used in the challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) in 2018. Our method obtains the normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 54.46\\%, and the clustering accuracy (CA) score of 63.64\\%, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of NMI and CA. In addition, both computational complexity and memory requirement of our method is lower than that of previous deep-model-based methods.

    abstract = "Distance estimation from audio plays a crucial role in various applications, such as acoustic scene analysis, sound source localization, and room modeling. Most studies predominantly center on employing a classification approach, where distances are discretized into distinct categories, enabling smoother model training and achieving higher accuracy but imposing restrictions on the precision of the obtained sound source position. Towards this direction, in this paper we propose a novel approach for continuous distance estimation from audio signals using a convolutional recurrent neural network with an attention module. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant temporal and spectral features, enhancing its ability to capture fine-grained distance-related information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using audio recordings in controlled environments with three levels of realism (synthetic room impulse response, measured response with convolved speech, and real recordings) on four datasets (our synthetic dataset, QMULTIMIT, VoiceHome-2, and STARSS23). Experimental results show that the model achieves an absolute error of 0.11 meters in a noiseless synthetic scenario. Moreover, the results showed an absolute error of about 1.30 meters in the hybrid scenario. The algorithm's performance in the real scenario, where unpredictable environmental factors and noise are prevalent, yields an absolute error of approximately 0.50 meters.",

We propose a novel SCM model in which the spatial properties are modeled by the weighted sum of direction of arrival (DOA) kernels. DOA kernels are obtained as the combination of phase and level difference covariance matrices representing both time and level differences between microphones for a grid of predefined source directions. The proposed SCM model is combined with the NMF model for the magnitude spectrograms. Opposite to other SCM models in the literature, in this work, source localization is implicitly defined in the model and estimated during the signal factorization. Therefore, no localization pre-processing is required. Parameters are estimated using complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) with both Euclidean distance and Itakura Saito divergence. Separation performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the two-channel SiSEC development dataset and four channels signals recorded in a regular room with moderate reverberation. Finally, a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods is performed, showing better achieved separation performance in terms of SIR and perceptual measures.",

    abstract = "Speech representation learning with self-supervised algorithms has resulted in notable performance boosts in many downstream tasks. Recent work combined self-supervised learning (SSL) and visually grounded speech (VGS) processing mechanisms for representation learning. The joint training with SSL and VGS mechanisms provides the opportunity to utilize both unlabeled speech and speech-related visual information based on data availability. This has shown to enhance the quality of learned representations, especially at encoding semantic- and lexical-level knowledge. In this work, we further study the joint optimization of wav2vec 2.0-based SSL and transformer-based VGS as a multitask learning system. We explore a set of training scenarios to understand how speech representations are shared or transferred between the two tasks, and what is the optimal training strategy for cross-modal semantic retrieval and phoneme discrimination performance. As a result, we find that sequential training with wav2vec 2.0 first and VGS next provides higher performance on audio-visual retrieval compared to simultaneous optimization of both learning mechanisms. However, the parallel SSL-VGS training reduces the effects of catastrophic forgetting when switching between optimization criteria. Moreover, the results suggest that phonemic representations learned through the VGS mechanism may generalize better across datasets compared to those learned with SSL.",

This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the large variety of potential sound sources in the scene, which may in addition have highly different acoustic characteristics, especially in bioacoustics. Furthermore, in realistic environments, multiple sources are often present simultaneously, and in reverberant conditions.",

We evaluate our method in a speech enhancement application, where a fully connected DNN is used to predict the clean speech spectrum from the input noisy speech spectrum. A DNN is optimized, its memory requirement is calculated, and its performance is evaluated using the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric. The application of the low-bit quantization leads to a 50\\% reduction of the DNN memory requirement while the STOI performance drops only by 2.7\\%.",

    abstract = "Researchers have recently started to study how the emotional speech heard by young infants can affect their developmental outcomes. As a part of this research, hundreds of hours of daylong recordings from preterm infants' audio environments were collected from two hospitals in Finland and Estonia in the context of so-called APPLE study. In order to analyze the emotional content of speech in such a massive dataset, an automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) system is required. However, there are no emotion labels or existing indomain SER systems to be used for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce this initially unannotated large-scale real-world audio dataset and describe the development of a functional SER system for the Finnish subset of the data. We explore the effectiveness of alternative state-of-the-art techniques to deploy a SER system to a new domain, comparing cross-corpus generalization, WGAN-based domain adaptation, and active learning in the task. As a result, we show that the best-performing models are able to achieve a classification performance of 73.4\\% unweighted average recall (UAR) and 73.2\\% UAR for a binary classification for valence and arousal, respectively. The results also show that active learning achieves the most consistent performance compared to the two alternatives.",

The BNMD models an audio spectrogram as a sum of delayed patterns having binary gains (activations). Only small subsets of patterns can be active for a given spectrogram excerpt. The proposed method was applied to speaker identification and separation tasks. The experimental results show that dictionaries obtained by the BNMD bring much higher speaker identification accuracies averaged over a range of SNRs from -6 dB to 9 dB (91.3\\%) than the NMD-based dictionaries (37.8-75.4\\%). The BNMD also gives a benefit over dictionaries obtained using vector quantization (87.8\\%). For bigger dictionaries the difference between the BNMD and the vector quantization (VQ) is getting smaller. For the speech separation task the BNMD dictionary gave a slight improvement over the VQ.",

    abstract = "Computational models of child language development can help us understand the cognitive underpinnings of the language learning process, which occurs along several linguistic levels at once (e.g., prosodic and phonological). However, in light of the replication crisis, modelers face the challenge of selecting representative and consolidated infant data. Thus, it is desirable to have evaluation methodologies that could account for robust empirical reference data, across multiple infant capabilities. Moreover, there is a need for practices that can compare developmental trajectories of infants to those of models as a function of language experience and development. The present study aims to take concrete steps to address these needs by introducing the concept of comparing models with large-scale cumulative empirical data from infants, as quantified by meta-analyses conducted across a large number of individual behavioral studies. We formalize the connection between measurable model and human behavior, and then present a conceptual framework for meta-analytic evaluation of computational models. We exemplify the meta-analytic model evaluation approach with two modeling experiments on infant-directed speech preference and native/non-native vowel discrimination.",

In such a model, it becomes possible to promote a phase value that originates from a signal model and to adjust the relative importance of this underlying model-based phase constraint. We conduct Bayesian inference of the model through the derivation of an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters. Experiments conducted on realistic music songs for a monaural source separation task, in an scenario where the variance parameters are assumed known, show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.",

In particular, the multiple input spectrogram inversion (MISI) algorithm has been exploited successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter. First, it has originally been introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals. Experiments conducted on a speech separation task show that oMISI performs as well as its offline counterpart, thus demonstrating its potential for real-time source separation.",

The approach uses a DNN consisting of a U-Net structure with a learnable preprocessing as well as a loss function consisting of mean average error, spatial correlation, and energy preservation components. The method is validated on two microphone arrays with regular and irregular shapes having four microphones, on simulated reverberant scenes with multiple sources.

    abstract = "Hearing aid users are challenged in listening situations with noise and especially speech-on-speech situations with two or more competing voices. Specifically, the task of attending to and segregating two competing voices is particularly hard, unlike for normal-hearing listeners, as shown in a small sub-experiment. In the main experiment, the competing voices benefit of a deep neural network (DNN) based stream segregation enhancement algorithm was tested on hearing-impaired listeners. A mixture of two voices was separated using a DNN and presented to the two ears as individual streams and tested for word score. Compared to the unseparated mixture, there was a 13\\%-point benefit from the separation, while attending to both voices. If only one output was selected as in a traditional target-masker scenario, a larger benefit of 37\\%-points was found. The results agreed well with objective metrics and show that for hearing-impaired listeners, DNNs have a large potential for improving stream segregation and speech intelligibility in difficult scenarios with two equally important targets without any prior selection of a primary target stream. An even higher benefit can be obtained if the user can select the preferred target via remote control.",

    abstract = "Speaking style conversion (SSC) is the technology of converting natural speech signals from one style to another. In this study, we aim to provide a general SSC system for converting styles with varying vocal effort and focus on normal-to-Lombard conversion as a case study of this problem. We propose a parametric approach that uses a vocoder to extract speech features. These features are mapped using parallel machine learning models from utterances spoken in normal style to the corresponding features of Lombard speech. Finally, the mapped features are converted to a Lombard speech waveform with the vocoder. A total of three vocoders (GlottDNN, STRAIGHT, and Pulse model in log domain (PML)) and three machine learning mapping methods (standard GMM, Bayesian GMM, and feed-forward DNN) were compared in the proposed normal-to-Lombard style conversion system. The conversion was evaluated using two subjective listening tests measuring perceived Lombardness and quality of the converted speech signals, and by using an instrumental measure called Speech Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB) for speech intelligibility evaluation under various noise levels. The results of the subjective tests show that the system is able to convert normal speech into Lombard speech and that there is a trade-off between quality and Lombardness of the mapped utterances. The GlottDNN and PML stand out as the best vocoders in terms of quality and Lombardness, respectively, whereas the DNN is the best mapping method in terms of Lombardness. PML with the standard GMM seems to give a good compromise between the two attributes. The SIIB experiments indicate that intelligibility of converted speech compared to that of normal speech improved in noisy conditions most effectively when DNN mapping was used with STRAIGHT and PML.",

Metrics from neighboring fields such as speech recognition and speaker diarization can be used, but they need to be partially redefined to deal with the overlapping events. We present a review of the most common metrics in the field and the way they are adapted and interpreted in the polyphonic case.

While most of the existing zero-shot learning methods focused on single-label classification tasks, the present study introduces a method to perform multi-label zero-shot audio classification. To address the challenge of classifying multi-label sounds while generalizing to unseen classes, we adapt temporal attention. The temporal attention mechanism assigns importance weights to different audio segments based on their acoustic and semantic compatibility, thus enabling the model to capture the varying dominance of different sound classes within an audio sample by focusing on the segments most relevant for each class. This leads to more accurate multi-label zero-shot classification than methods employing temporally aggregated acoustic features without weighting, which treat all audio segments equally. We evaluate our approach on a subset of AudioSet against a zero-shot model using uniformly aggregated acoustic features, a zero-rule baseline, and the proposed method in the supervised scenario. Our results show that temporal attention enhances the zero-shot audio classification performance in multi-label scenario.",

The annotated label on a medoid propagates to other samples in its cluster for label prediction. After annotating the medoids, the annotation continues to the unexamined sounds with mismatched prediction results from two classifiers, a nearest-neighbor classifier and a model-based classifier, both trained with annotated data. The annotation on the segments with mismatched predictions are ordered by the distance to the nearest annotated sample, farthest first. The evaluation is made on a public environmental sound dataset. The labels obtained through a labeling process controlled by the proposed method are used to train a classifier, using supervised learning. Only 20\\% of the data needs to be manually annotated with the proposed method, to achieve the accuracy with all the data annotated. In addition, the proposed method clearly outperforms other active learning algorithms proposed for sound event classification through all the experiments, simulating varying fraction of data that is manually labeled.",

    abstract = "Background: Human movement activity is commonly recorded with inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors in many science disciplines. The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection of different postures and movements, which may support more detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative recording configurations and the attainable analyses of naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal resolution derivative statistics when the data represents naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving infants (N=41; age range 4‐18 months) recorded with a multisensor wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a modest reduction in movement classification performance (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58). Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53). These findings have direct implications for the design of future studies and wearable solutions that aim to quantify spontaneously occurring postures and movements in natural behaviors.",

The prediction model is initially pre-trained on available annotated sound event data with classes that are disjoint from the classes in the unlabeled dataset. The prediction model then gradually adapts to the annotations provided by the annotator in an active learning loop. We derive query segments to guide the weak label annotator towards strong labels, using change point detection on these probabilities.

In this study, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based audio segmentation method to identify the relevant acoustic parts of the cry signal (i.e., expiratory and inspiratory phases) from recordings made in natural environments with various interfering acoustic sources. We examine and optimize the performance of the system by using different audio features and HMM topologies. In particular, we propose using fundamental frequency and aperiodicity features. We also propose a method for adapting the segmentation system trained on acoustic material captured in a particular acoustic environment to a different acoustic environment by using feature normalization and semi-supervised learning (SSL). The performance of the system was evaluated by analyzing a total of 3 h and 10 min of audio material from 109 infants, captured in a variety of recording conditions in hospital wards and clinics. The proposed system yields frame-based accuracy up to 89.2\\%. We conclude that the proposed system offers a solution for automated segmentation of cry signals in cry analysis applications.",

    abstract = "State-of-the-art sound event detection (SED) methods usually employ a series of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract useful features from the input audio signal, and then recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model longer temporal context in the extracted features. The number of the channels of the CNNs and size of the weight matrices of the RNNs have a direct effect on the total amount of parameters of the SED method, which is to a couple of millions. Additionally, the usually long sequences that are used as an input to an SED method along with the employment of an RNN, introduce implications like increased training time, difficulty at gradient flow, and impeding the parallelization of the SED method. To tackle all these problems, we propose the replacement of the CNNs with depthwise separable convolutions and the replacement of the RNNs with dilated convolutions. We compare the proposed method to a baseline convolutional neural network on a SED task, and achieve a reduction of the amount of parameters by 85\\% and average training time per epoch by 78\\%, and an increase the average frame-wise F1 score and reduction of the average error rate by 4.6\\% and 3.8\\%, respectively.",

The proposed method first separates the observed array mixture signal into single speaker array signals using deep clustering (DC), which is a deep neural network (DNN) based method that maps source signal information into an embedding space, in which a clustering algorithm can be then used to separate the sources. Spatial information in terms of time difference of arrival (TDoA) can be then extracted from each separated signal. This approach is novel for TDoA estimation of multiple sources, since the state-of-the-art method first localizes multiple sources and then performs the separation. The inherent advantage of the proposed approach is that there is no need for data association of the measurements and the sources. The results with data from an actual room show that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the- art in extracting the spatial information from two concurrent speakers mixture signal.",

It is used by the audio engineering community for decades for audio recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the recording practice itself. But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For all the above cases we calculate the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric. The results obtained clearly demonstrate an optimum close-miking performance that matches the current empirical knowledge of professional audio recording.",

In this work, we present a method for self-supervised representation learning based on audio-visual spatial alignment (AVSA), a more sophisticated alignment task than the audio-visual correspondence (AVC). In addition to the correspondence, AVSA also learns from the spatial location of acoustic and visual content. Based on 360° video and Ambisonics audio, we propose selection of visual objects using object detection, and beamforming of the audio signal towards the detected objects, attempting to learn the spatial alignment between objects and the sound they produce. We investigate the use of spatial audio features to represent the audio input, and different audio formats: Ambisonics, mono, and stereo. Experimental results show a 10\\% improvement on AVSA for the first order ambisonics intensity vector (FOA-IV) in comparison with log-mel spectrogram features; the addition of object-oriented crops also brings significant performance increases for the human action recognition downstream task. A number of audio-only downstream tasks are devised for testing the effectiveness of the learnt audio feature representation, obtaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on acoustic scene classification from ambisonic and binaural audio.",

    abstract = "The spatial information about a sound source is carried by acoustic waves to a microphone array and can be observed through estimation of phase and amplitude differences between microphones. Time difference of arrival (TDoA) captures the propagation delay of the wavefront between microphones and can be used to steer a beamformer or to localize the source. However, reverberation and interference can deteriorate the TDoA estimate. Deep neural networks (DNNs) through supervised learning can extract speech related TDoAs in more adverse conditions than traditional correlation -based methods. Acoustic simulations provide large amounts of data with annotations, while real recordings require manual annotations or the use of reference sensors with proper calibration procedures. The distributions of these two data sources can differ. When a DNN model that is trained using simulated data is presented with real data from a different distribution, its performance decreases if not properly addressed. For the reduction of DNN –based TDoA estimation error, this work investigates the role of different input normalization techniques, mixing of simulated and real data for training, and applying an adversarial domain adaptation technique. Results quantify the reduction in TDoA error for real data using the different approaches. It is evident that the use of normalization methods, domain-adaptation, and real data during training can reduce the TDoA error.",

A mixture signal is separated through factorisation of a feature-tensor representation, based on the modulation spectrogram. Harmonically related components tend to modulate in a similar fashion, and this redundancy of patterns can be isolated. This feature representation requires fewer parameters than spectrally based methods and so minimises overfitting. Following the tensor factorisation, the separated signals are reconstructed by learning appropriate Wiener-filter spectral parameters which have been constrained by activation parameters learned in the first stage. Strong results were obtained for two-speaker mixtures where source separation performance exceeded those used as benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed semi-supervised method outperformed both semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorisation and blind non-negative modulation spectrum tensor factorisation.",

    title = "Is Reliability of Cognitive Measures in Children Dependent on Participant Age? A Case Study with Two Large-Scale Datasets",
    abstract = "When assessing children in laboratory experiments, the measured responses also contain task-irrelevant participant-level variability (“noise”) and measurement noise. Since experimental data are used to make inferences of development of cognitive capabilities with age, it is important to know if reliability of the used measurements depends on child age. Any systematic age-dependent changes in reliability could result in misleading developmental trajectories, as lower reliability will necessarily result in smaller effect sizes. This paper examines age-dependency of task-independent measurement variability in early childhood (3–40 months) by analyzing two large-scale datasets of participant-level experimental responses: the ManyBabies infant-directed speech preference (MB-IDS) dataset and a saccadic reaction time (SRT) dataset collected from rural South Africa. Analysis of participant- and study-level data reveals that MB-IDS shows comparable reliability across the included age range. In contrast, SRTs reflect systematically increasing measurement consistency with increasing age. Potential reasons and implications of this divergence are briefly discussed.",

Estimation of sound wave direction of arrival (DOA) based on time differences between separate microphones is typically applied for sound source localization, and the existing research achievements of the field are utilized in the presented study. In this paper, a new method for estimating the state of a supersonic bullet is proposed. State is defined here to consist of bullet{\textquoteright}s trajectory, caliber, and speed. The method is based on a mathematical modeling of the bullet shock wave, and the parameter estimation procedure is built over the Bayesian inference. Both simulations and real shooting data are used to test and verify the performance of the proposed method. Bringing shock wave modeling and Bayesian inference together is the main focus of the study.",

DCASE 2017 presented participants with three such tasks, each having specific datasets and detection requirements: Task 2, in which target sound events were very rare in both training and testing data, Task 3 having overlapping events annotated in real-life audio, and Task 4, in which only weakly labeled data were available for training. In this paper, we present three tasks, including the datasets and baseline systems, and analyze the challenge entries for each task. We observe the popularity of methods using deep neural networks, and the still widely used mel frequency-based representations, with only few approaches standing out as radically different. Analysis of the systems behavior reveals that task-specific optimization has a big role in producing good performance; however, often this optimization closely follows the ranking metric, and its maximization/minimization does not result in universally good performance. We also introduce the calculation of confidence intervals based on a jackknife resampling procedure to perform statistical analysis of the challenge results. The analysis indicates that while the 95\\% confidence intervals for many systems overlap, there are significant differences in performance between the top systems and the baseline for all tasks.",

V C is carried out via local minima detection in the predicted distance. We propose to set the minima detection threshold at a point where the probabilities of false positives and false negatives coincide so they statistically cancel each other in total vehicle number. The method is trained and tested on a traffic-monitoring dataset comprising 422 short, 20-second one-channel sound files with a total of 1421 vehicles passing by the microphone. Relative V C error in a traffic location not used in the training is below 2\\% within a wide range of detection threshold values.

Take for example the sound produced by a gun firing. Does the emotional impact arise from the fact that the listener recognizes that a gun produced the sound (semantic content) or does it arise from the attributes of the sound created by the firing gun? This research explores the relation between the semantic similarity of the sound events and the elicited emotions. Results indicate that the semantic content seems to have a limited role in the conformation of the listener{\textquoteright}s affective states. However, when the semantic content is matched to specific areas in the Arousal-Valence space or when the source{\textquoteright}s spatial position is considered, the effect of the semantic content is higher, especially for the cases of medium to low valence and medium to high arousal or when the sound source is at the lateral positions of the listener{\textquoteright}s head.",

    abstract = {A sound event detection (SED) method typically takes as an input a sequence of audio frames and predicts the activities of sound events in each frame. In real-life recordings, the sound events exhibit some temporal structure: for instance, a {"}car horn{"} will likely be followed by a {"}car passing by{"}. While this temporal structure is widely exploited in sequence prediction tasks (e.g., in machine translation), where language models (LM) are exploited, it is not satisfactorily modeled in SED. In this work we propose a method which allows a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn an LM for the SED task. The method conditions the input of the RNN with the activities of classes at the previous time step. We evaluate our method using F1 score and error rate (ER) over three different and publicly available datasets; the TUT-SED Synthetic 2016 and the TUT Sound Events 2016 and 2017 datasets. The obtained results show an increase of 9\\% and 2\\% at the F1 (higher is better) and a decrease of 7\\% and 2\\% at ER (lower is better) for the TUT Sound Events 2016 and 2017 datasets, respectively, when using our method.

    title = "Building a Naturalistic and Representative Affective Speech Corpus for the Finnish Language",
    abstract = "Spoken language contains affective (emotional) information, which is conveyed by suprasegmental variation (e.g prosody and phonation) in speech as well as by other situational variation such as word choices along with dialectal, syntactic and semantic variation. The information is ultimately perceived by the listener as subjective interpretations. While affect is part of everyday conversational communication, there is little existing research on expression and perception of affect in spoken Finnish [8][7], not to mention across different idiolectal subgroups such as speakers of different age or dialectal background. Since expression and interpretation of affect in language is known to depend on cultural and social conventions, better understanding of the expression of affect in Finnish would be desirable. The goal of our work is to research how affect is expressed in everyday spoken Finnish using large-scale data. A prerequisite for our research on affective language is a speech corpus containing unscripted audio recordings of speech paired with metadata (or annotations) containing information about the affective expression. However, we are aware of only two Finnish speech corpora related to affect, both consisting of acted emotional expressions while reading a pre-defined script and consisting only a small amount of speech in total [1][5]. In contrast, several large-scale datasets containing unscripted speech in Finnish exists [4][2][6], but they lack affect related metadata. Building an affective speech corpus can be done in several ways, typically by recording acted speech in a controlled setting or utilizing publicly available free speech audio sources from different medias such as podcasts, radio or television. The trade-off when building these types of datasets is typically between the richness and balance of affective expression present in the data and the level of information the dataset contains about the expression in the data [3]. In this presentation, we will describe our approach to compiling a spoken Finnish dataset for the study of affective expression by combining the LahjoitaPuhetta, HelPuhe and TamPuhe datasets. The dataset will be built by aligning the audio recordings with their respective text transcriptions and split into individual utterance samples (consisting of audio and text). Each utterance sample in the dataset will be augmented with a text sentiment, speech-to-noise ratio and audio based emotion estimates first by using automated tools and finally annotating a subset of samples manually. The final dataset can be used to build better tools for automated affect related annotation providing more options for researching affect and idiolectical variation using large-scale data.

Whereas most group sparse models require explicit division of atoms into separate groups without addressing their mutual relations, we propose a constraint that permits dynamic relationships between atoms or groups, based on any defined distance measure.

Accordingly, early detection of infants with atypical motor development holds promise for recognizing those infants who are at risk for a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders). Previously, novel wearable technology has shown promise for offering efficient, scalable and automated methods for movement assessment in adults. Here, we describe the development of an infant wearable, a multi-sensor smart jumpsuit that allows mobile accelerometer and gyroscope data collection during movements. Using this suit, we first recorded play sessions of 22 typically developing infants of approximately 7 months of age. These data were manually annotated for infant posture and movement based on video recordings of the sessions, and using a novel annotation scheme specifically designed to assess the overall movement pattern of infants in the given age group. A machine learning algorithm, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was then trained for automatic detection of posture and movement classes using the data and annotations. Our experiments show that the setup can be used for quantitative tracking of infant movement activities with a human equivalent accuracy, i.e., it meets the human inter-rater agreement levels in infant posture and movement classification. We also quantify the ambiguity of human observers in analyzing infant movements, and propose a method for utilizing this uncertainty for performance improvements in training of the automated classifier. Comparison of different sensor configurations also shows that four-limb recording leads to the best performance in posture and movement classification.",

In this paper, we propose the use of an asymmetric analysis-synthesis window pair which allows for training with targets with better frequency resolution, while retaining the low-latency during inference suitable for real-time speech enhancement or assisted hearing applications. In order to assess our approach across various model types and datasets, we evaluate it with a speaker-independent deep clustering (DC) model and a speaker-dependent mask inference (MI) model. We report an improvement in separation performance of up to 1.5 dB in terms of source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) while maintaining an algorithmic latency of 8 ms.",

    title = "Automatic word count estimation from daylong child-centered recordings in various language environments using language-independent syllabification of speech",
    abstract = "Automatic word count estimation (WCE) from audio recordings can be used to quantify the amount of verbal communication in a recording environment. One key application of WCE is to measure language input heard by infants and toddlers in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings from microphones worn by the infants. Although WCE is nearly trivial for high-quality signals in high-resource languages, daylong recordings are substantially more challenging due to the unconstrained acoustic environments and the presence of near- and far-field speech. Moreover, many use cases of interest involve languages for which reliable ASR systems or even well-defined lexicons are not available. A good WCE system should also perform similarly for low- and high-resource languages in order to enable unbiased comparisons across different cultures and environments. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art solution, the LENA system, is based on proprietary software and has only been optimized for American English, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we build on existing work on WCE and present the steps we have taken towards a freely available system for WCE that can be adapted to different languages or dialects with a limited amount of orthographically transcribed speech data. Our system is based on language-independent syllabification of speech, followed by a language-dependent mapping from syllable counts (and a number of other acoustic features) to the corresponding word count estimates. We evaluate our system on samples from daylong infant recordings from six different corpora consisting of several languages and socioeconomic environments, all manually annotated with the same protocol to allow direct comparison. We compare a number of alternative techniques for the two key components in our system: speech activity detection and automatic syllabification of speech. As a result, we show that our system can reach relatively consistent WCE accuracy across multiple corpora and languages (with some limitations). In addition, the system outperforms LENA on three of the four corpora consisting of different varieties of English. We also demonstrate how an automatic neural network-based syllabifier, when trained on multiple languages, generalizes well to novel languages beyond the training data, outperforming two previously proposed unsupervised syllabifiers as a feature extractor for WCE.",

These developments owe much to the creation and use of large-scale, multitrack datasets dedicated to these specific components. However, the challenge of extracting similarly sounding sources from orchestra recordings has not been extensively explored, largely due to a scarcity of comprehensive and clean (i.e bleed-free) multitrack datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitrack dataset called SynthSOD, developed using a set of simulation techniques to create a realistic, musically motivated, and heterogeneous training set comprising different dynamics, natural tempo changes, styles, and conditions by employing high-quality digital libraries that define virtual instrument sounds for MIDI playback (a.k.a., soundfonts). Moreover, we demonstrate the application of a widely used baseline music separation model trained on our synthesized dataset w.r.t to the well-known EnsembleSet, and evaluate its performance under both synthetic and real-world conditions.",

The proposed processing is separating the scene into a sum of small number of sources, and the spectrogram of each of them is in turn represented as a small number of latent components. The direction of arrival (DOA) of each source is estimated, which is followed by binaural rendering of each source at its estimated direction. For representing the sources, the proposed method uses low-rank complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization combined with DOA-based spatial covariance matrix model. The binaural reconstruction is achieved by applying the binaural cues (head-related transfer function) associated with the estimated source DOA to the separated source signals. The binaural rendering quality of the proposed method was evaluated using a speech intelligibility test. The test results indicated that the proposed binaural rendering was able to improve the intelligibility of speech over stereo recordings and separation by minimum variance distortionless response beamformer with the same binaural synthesis in a three-speaker scenario. An additional listening test evaluating the subjective quality of the rendered output indicates no added processing artifacts by the proposed method in comparison to unprocessed stereo recording.",

In this paper a feasibility study is presented on a new monitoring concept in which an acoustic pattern classification algorithm running in a wireless sensor is used to automatically assign the measured sound level to different noise sources. A supervised noise source classifier is learned from a small amount of manually annotated recordings and the learned classifier is used to automatically detect the activity of target noise source in the presence of interfering noise sources. The sensor is based on an inexpensive credit-card-sized single-board computer with a microphone and associated electronics and wireless connectivity. The measurement results and the noise source information are transferred from the sensors scattered around the measurement site to a cloud service and a noise portal is used to visualise the measurements to users. The proposed noise monitoring concept was piloted on a rock crushing site. The system ran reliably over 50 days on site, during which it was able to recognise more than 90\\% of the noise sources correctly. The pilot study shows that the proposed noise monitoring system can reduce the amount of required human validation of the sound level measurements when the target noise source is clearly defined.",

    title = "A pipeline for stochastic and controlled generation of realistic language input for simulating infant language acquisition",
    abstract = "Computational models of early language development involve implementing theories of learning as functional learning algorithms, exposing these models to realistic language input, and comparing learning outcomes to those in infants. While recent research has made major strides in developing more powerful learning models and evaluation protocols grounded in infant data, models are still predominantly trained with non-naturalistic input data, such as crowd-sourced read speech or text transcripts. This is due to the lack of suitable child-directed speech (CDS) corpora in terms of scale and quality. In parallel, the question of how properties and individual variability in language input affect learning outcomes is an active area of empirical research, underlining the need for realistic yet controllable data for modeling such phenomena. This paper presents a solution to the training data problem through stochastic generation of naturalistic CDS data using statistical models, thereby enabling controlled computational simulations with naturalistic input. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the approach by showing how naturalistic CDS transcripts can be generated with a language model conditioned on recipient information (here, infant age), and how text-to-speech systems can be used to convert the transcripts to high-quality speech with a controllable speaking style. We also conduct modeling experiments with generated speech corpora by varying different aspects of the data, showing how this maps into different learning outcomes, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for controlled language learning simulations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of using synthetic data in general, and of the present proof-of-concept pipeline in particular.",

This task has attracted 43 submissions from 13 different teams around the world. Among all submissions, more than half of the submitted systems have better performance than the baseline. The common techniques among the top systems are the usage of large pretrained models such as ResNet or EfficientNet which are trained for the task-specific problem. Fine-tuning, transfer learning, and data augmentation techniques are also employed to boost the performance. More importantly, multi-modal methods using both audio and video are employed by all the top 5 teams. The best system among all achieved a logloss of 0.195 and accuracy of 93.8\textbackslash{}\\%, compared to the baseline system with logloss of 0.662 and accuracy of 77.1\\%.",

Although RNNs are in many cases superior than other types of deep neural networks for sequence processing, they are known to have specific difficulties in training and parallelization, especially for the typically long sequences encountered in music source separation. In this paper we present a use-case of replacing RNNs with depth-wise separable (DWS) convolutions, which are a lightweight and faster variant of the typical convolutions. We focus on singing voice separation, employing an RNN architecture, and we replace the RNNs with DWS convolutions (DWS-CNNs). We conduct an ablation study and examine the effect of the number of channels and layers of DWS-CNNs on the source separation performance, by utilizing the standard metrics of signal-to-artifacts, signal-to-interference, and signal-to-distortion ratio. Our results show that by replacing RNNs with DWS-CNNs yields an improvement of 1.20, 0.06, 0.37 dB, respectively, while using only 20.57\\% of the amount of parameters of the RNN architecture.",

Regression-based approaches have certain advantages over classification-based, such as continuous direction-of-arrival estimation of static and moving sources. However, multi-source scenarios require multiple regressors without a clear training strategy up-to-date, that does not rely on auxiliary information such as simultaneous sound classification. We investigate end-to-end training of such methods with a technique recently proposed for video object detectors, adapted to the SSL setting. A differentiable network is constructed that can be plugged to the output of the localizer to solve the optimal assignment between predictions and references, optimizing directly the popular CLEAR-MOT tracking metrics. Results indicate large improvements over directly optimizing mean squared errors, in terms of localization error, detection metrics, and tracking capabilities.",

Our goal is to obtain a classifier that is capable of recognizing audio instances of sound classes that have no available training samples, but only semantic side information. We employ a bilinear compatibility framework to learn an acoustic-semantic projection between intermediate-level representations of audio instances and sound classes, i.e., acoustic embeddings and semantic embeddings. We use VGGish to extract deep acoustic embeddings from audio clips, and pre-trained language models (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to generate either label embeddings from textual labels or sentence embeddings from sentence descriptions of sound classes. Audio classification is performed by a linear compatibility function that measures how compatible an acoustic embedding and a semantic embedding are. We evaluate the proposed method on a small balanced dataset ESC-50 and a large-scale unbalanced audio subset of AudioSet. The experimental results show that classification performance is significantly improved by involving sound classes that are semantically close to the test classes in training. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that both label embeddings and sentence embeddings are useful for zero-shot learning. Classification performance is improved by concatenating label/sentence embeddings generated with different language models. With their hybrid concatenations, the results are improved further.",

In this study, we propose the use of cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGANs) for converting styles with varying vocal effort, and focus on conversion between normal and Lombard styles as a case study of this problem. We propose a parametric approach that uses the Pulse Model in Log domain (PML) vocoder to extract speech features. These features are mapped using the CycleGAN from utterances in the source style to the corresponding features of target speech. Finally, the mapped features are converted to a Lombard speech waveform with the PML. The CycleGAN was compared in subjective listening tests with 2 other standard mapping methods used in conversion, and the CycleGAN was found to have the best performance in terms of speech quality and in terms of the magnitude of the perceptual change between the two styles.",

Conventionally, the spectrum-related features take into account merely the magnitude information, whereas the phase is often overlooked due to the complications related to its interpretation. However, there is often additional information concealed in the phase, which could be beneficial for recognition. The APGD is an elegant approach to inferring phase information, which lacks of the issues related to interpreting the phase and does not require extensive parameter adjustment. Having shown applicability for speech-related problems, it is now explored in terms of instrument recognition. The evaluation is performed with various instrument sets and shows noteworthy absolute accuracy gains of up to 7\\% compared to the baseline mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) case. Combined with the MFCCs and with feature selection, APGD demonstrates superiority over the baseline with all the evaluated sets.",

Experiments show that the NN-based distance regression outperforms by far the previously proposed support vector regression. The 95\\% confidence interval for the mean of vehicle counting error is within [0.28\\%, −0.55\\%]. Besides the minima-based counting, we propose a deep learning counting that operates on the predicted distance without detecting local minima. Although outperformed in accuracy by the former approach, deep counting has a significant advantage in that it does not depend on minima detection parameters. Results also show that removing low frequencies in features improves the counting performance.",

The present study investigates the behaviour of two predictive coding models, Autoregressive Predictive Coding and Contrastive Predictive Coding, in a phoneme discrimination task (ABX task) for two languages with different dataset sizes. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the autoregressive loss and the phoneme discrimination scores with the two datasets. However, to our surprise, the CPC model shows rapid convergence already after one pass over the training data, and, on average, its representations outperform those of APC on both languages.",

    abstract = "Abstract The increase of mobile devices and most recently wearables has raised the interest to utilize their sensors for various applications such as indoor localization. We present the first acoustic self-localization scheme that is passive, and is capable of operating when sensors are moving, and possibly unsynchronized. As a result, the relative microphone positions are obtained and therefore an ad hoc microphone array has been established. The proposed system takes advantage of the knowledge that a device is worn by its user e.g. attached to his/her clothing. A user here acts as a sound source and the sensor is the user-worn microphone. Such an entity is referred to as a node. Node-related spatial information is obtained from Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimated from audio captured by the nodes. Kalman filtering is used for node tracking and prediction of spatial information during periods of node silence. Finally, the node positions are recovered using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The only information required by the proposed system is observations of sounds produced by the nodes such as speech to localize the moving nodes. The general framework for acoustic self-localization is presented followed by an implementation to demonstrate the concept. Real data collected by off-the-shelf equipment is used to evaluate the positioning accuracy of nodes in contrast to image based method. The presented system achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 cm in an acoustic laboratory.",

    abstract = "Audio captioning is the task of automatically creating a textual description for the contents of a general audio signal. Typical audio captioning methods rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), where the target of the DNN is to map the input audio sequence to an output sequence of words, i.e. the caption. Though, the length of the textual description is considerably less than the length of the audio signal, for example 10 words versus some thousands of audio feature vectors. This clearly indicates that an output word corresponds to multiple input feature vectors. In this work we present an approach that focuses on explicitly taking advantage of this difference of lengths between sequences, by applying a temporal sub-sampling to the audio input sequence. We employ a sequence-to-sequence method, which uses a fixed-length vector as an output from the encoder, and we apply temporal sub-sampling between the RNNs of the encoder. We evaluate the benefit of our approach by employing the freely available dataset Clotho and we evaluate the impact of different factors of temporal sub-sampling. Our results show an improvement to all considered metrics.",

The cross-attention maps audio features that are relevant to the textual features to produce answers.

Our results clearly show improvement over the reference method reported in the original paper. On the yes/no binary classification task, our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 68.3\\% compared to 62.7\\% in the reference model.

Using the proposed spatial features over monaural features on the same network gives an absolute F-score improvement of 6.1\\% on the publicly available TUT-SED 2016 dataset and 2.7\\% on the TUT-SED 2009 dataset that is fifteen times larger.",

    abstract = "Speech separation algorithms are faced with a difficult task of producing high degree of separation without containing unwanted artifacts. The time-frequency (T-F) masking technique applies a real-valued (or binary) mask on top of the signal's spectrum to filter out unwanted components. The practical difficulty lies in the mask estimation. Often, using efficient masks engineered for separation performance leads to presence of unwanted musical noise artifacts in the separated signal. This lowers the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the output. Microphone arrays have been long studied for processing of distant speech. This work uses a feed-forward neural network for mapping microphone array's spatial features into a T-F mask. Wiener filter is used as a desired mask for training the neural network using speech examples in simulated setting. The T-F masks predicted by the neural network are combined to obtain an enhanced separation mask that exploits the information regarding interference between all sources. The final mask is applied to the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) output. The algorithm's objective separation capability in conjunction with the separated speech intelligibility is tested with recorded speech from distant talkers in two rooms from two distances. The results show improvement in instrumental measure for intelligibility and frequency-weighted SNR over complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation approach, spatial sound source separation, and conventional beamforming methods such as the DSB and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR).",

In the presence of interference and reverberation, the map will exhibit multiple peaks with heights related to the corresponding sound's spectral content. Often in realistic use cases, the target of interest (such as speech) can exhibit a lower peak compared to an interference source. This will corrupt any direction dependent method, such as beamforming. Regression has been used to predict time-frequency (TF) regions corrupted by reverberation, and static broadband noise can be efficiently estimated for TF points. TF regions dominated by noise or reverberation can then be de-emphasized to obtain more reliable source direction estimates. In this work, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the prediction of a TF mask for emphasizing the direct path speech signal in time-varying interference. SRP with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) combined with the CNN-based masking is shown to be capable of reducing the impact of time-varying interference for speaker direction estimation using real speech sources in reverberation.",

With respect to the genre and style of the audio content, the parameters of these techniques are controlled by a mastering engineer, in order to process the original audio material. This operation relies on musical and perceptually pleasing facets of the perceived acoustic characteristics, transmitted from the audio material under the mastering process. Modeling such dynamic operations, which involve adaptation regarding the audio content, becomes vital in automated applications since it significantly affects the overall performance. In this work we present a system capable of modelling such behavior focusing on the automatic dynamic range compression. It predicts frequency coefficients that allow the dynamic range compression, via a trained deep neural network, and applies them to unmastered audio signal served as input. Both dynamic range compression and the prediction of the corresponding frequency coefficients take place inside the time-frequency domain, using magnitude spectra acquired from a critical band filter bank, similar to humans{\textquoteright} peripheral auditory system.

Typically, spectrogram inversion is treated as an optimization problem involving one or several terms in order to promote estimates that comply with a consistency property, a mixing constraint, and/or a target magnitude objective. Nonetheless, it is still unclear which set of constraints and problem formulation is the most appropriate in practice. In this paper, we design a general framework for deriving spectrogram inversion algorithm, which is based on formulating optimization problems by combining these objectives either as soft penalties or hard constraints. We solve these by means of algorithms that perform alternating projections on the subsets corresponding to each objective/constraint. Our framework encompasses existing techniques from the literature as well as novel algorithms. We investigate the potential of these approaches for a speech enhancement task. In particular, one of our novel algorithms outperforms other approaches in a realistic setting where the magnitudes are estimated beforehand using a neural network.",

For achieving high performance, DNNs often need a large amount of annotated data which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a method for learning audio representations, aligning the learned latent representations of audio and associated tags. Aligning is done by maximizing the agreement of the latent representations of audio and tags, using a contrastive loss. The result is an audio embedding model which reflects acoustic and semantic characteristics of sounds. We evaluate the quality of our embedding model, measuring its performance as a feature extractor on three different tasks (namely, sound event recognition, and music genre and musical instrument classification), and investigate what type of characteristics the model captures. Our results are promising, sometimes in par with the state-of-the-art in the considered tasks and the embeddings produced with our method are well correlated with some acoustic descriptors.",

Real life sound recordings typically have many overlapping sound events, making it hard to recognize with just mono channel audio. Human listeners have been successfully recognizing the mixture of overlapping sound events using pitch cues and exploiting the stereo (multichannel) audio signal available at their ears to spatially localize these events. Traditionally SED systems have only been using mono channel audio, motivated by the human listener we propose to extend them to use multichannel audio. The proposed SED system is compared against the state of the art mono channel method on the development subset of TUT sound events detection 2016 database. The proposed method improves the F-score by 3.75\\% while reducing the error rate by 6\\%.",

While its estimation was originally based on the Euclidean distance, in this paper we propose to extend it to any beta-divergence, a family of functions widely used in audio to estimate NMF. To this end, we introduce the beta-divergence in a heuristic fashion within a phase-aware probabilistic model. Estimating this model results in performing an NMF with Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence on a quantity called the phase-corrected posterior power of the sources, which is both phase-dependent and nonnegative-valued. Therefore, we replace IS with the beta-divergence, so that the factorization uses an optimal distortion metric and remains phase-aware. Even though by doing so we loose theoretical convergence guarantees, the resulting algorithm demonstrates its potential for an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous complex NMFs approaches.",

The method takes as inputs the MA geometry and MA signals and uses a multi-level encoder consisting of separate paths for geometry and signal data, where geometry features inform the signal encoder at each level. The method is validated in simulated anechoic and reverberant conditions with one and two sources. The results indicate improvement over conventional encoding across the whole frequency range for dry scenes, while for reverberant scenes the improvement is frequency-dependent.",

Its success comes from a combination of factors: the challenge offers a large variety of tasks that are renewed each year; and the workshop offers a channel for dissemination of related work, engaging a young and dynamic community. At the same time, DCASE faces its own challenges, growing and expanding to different areas. One of the core principles of DCASE is open science and reproducibility: publicly available datasets, baseline systems, technical reports and workshop publications.

    title = "PFML: Self-Supervised Learning of Time-Series Data Without Representation Collapse",
    abstract = "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers{\textquoteright} time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.",

However, captured speech typically contains dynamic non-speech interference sources and noise. Therefore, the TDoA estimates fluctuate between speech and interference. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied for Time-Frequency (TF) masking for Acoustic Source Localization (ASL) to filter out non-speech components from a speaker location likelihood function. However, the type of TF mask for this task is not obvious. Secondly, the DNN should estimate the TDoA values, but existing solutions estimate the TF mask instead. To overcome these issues, a direct formulation of the TF masking as a part of a DNN-based ASL structure is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed network operates in an online manner, i.e., producing estimates frame-by-frame. Combined with the use of recurrent layers it exploits the sequential progression of speaker related TDoAs. Training with different microphone spacings allows model re-use for different microphone pair geometries in inference. Real-data experiments with smartphone recordings of speech in interference demonstrate the network's generalization capability.",

    title = "Analysing the Impact of Audio Quality on the Use of Naturalistic Long-Form Recordings for Infant-Directed Speech Research",
    abstract = "Modelling of early language acquisition aims to understand how infants bootstrap their language skills. The modelling encompasses properties of the input data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their algorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to compare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more naturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates development of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step towards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of speech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major drawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is currently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling experiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for the case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) analysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of utterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in English and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an in-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data. Finally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change the conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning model. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality naturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS in terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments. We also found that an automatic sound quality assessment tool can be used to screen out useful parts of long-form recordings for a closer analysis with comparable results to that of manual quality annotation.",

    title = "ALICE: An open-source tool for automatic measurement of phoneme, syllable, and word counts from child-centered daylong recordings",
    abstract = "Recordings captured by wearable microphones are a standard method for investigating young children{\textquoteright}s language environments. A key measure to quantify from such data is the amount of speech present in children{\textquoteright}s home environments. To this end, the LENA recorder and software—a popular system for measuring linguistic input—estimates the number of adult words that children may hear over the course of a recording. However, word count estimation is challenging to do in a language- independent manner; the relationship between observable acoustic patterns and language-specific lexical entities is far from uniform across human languages. In this paper, we ask whether some alternative linguistic units, namely phone(me)s or syllables, could be measured instead of, or in parallel with, words in order to achieve improved cross-linguistic applicability and comparability of an automated system for measuring child language input. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of measuring different units from theoretical and technical points of view. We also investigate the practical applicability of measuring such units using a novel system called Automatic LInguistic unit Count Estimator (ALICE) together with audio from seven child-centered daylong audio corpora from diverse cultural and linguistic environments. We show that language-independent measurement of phoneme counts is somewhat more accurate than syllables or words, but all three are highly correlated with human annotations on the same data. We share an open-source implementation of ALICE for use by the language research community, enabling automatic phoneme, syllable, and word count estimation from child-centered audio recordings.",

    abstract = {Audio captioning is a multi-modal task, focusing on using natural language for describing the contents of general audio. Most audio captioning methods are based on deep neural networks, employing an encoder-decoder scheme and a dataset with audio clips and corresponding natural language descriptions (i.e. captions). A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of words in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically non-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. {"}a{"}, {"}the{"}), and other words are infrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns). In this paper we propose two methods to mitigate this class imbalance problem. First, in an autoencoder setting for audio captioning, we weigh each word's contribution to the training loss inversely proportional to its number of occurrences in the whole dataset. Secondly, in addition to multi-class, word-level audio captioning task, we define a multi-label side task based on clip-level content word detection by training a separate decoder. We use the loss from the second task to regularize the jointly trained encoder for the audio captioning task. We evaluate our method using Clotho, a recently published, wide-scale audio captioning dataset, and our results show an increase of 37\\% relative improvement with SPIDEr metric over the baseline method.},

    abstract = "Sound event detection systems are widely used in various applications such as surveillance and environmental monitoring where data is automatically collected, processed, and sent to a cloud for sound recognition. However, this process may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about users or their surroundings, hence raising privacy concerns. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial training method for learning representations of audio recordings that effectively prevents the detection of speech activity from the latent features of the recordings. The proposed method trains a model to generate invariant latent representations of speech-containing audio recordings that cannot be distinguished from non-speech recordings by a speech classifier. The novelty of our work is in the optimization algorithm, where the speech classifier's weights are regularly replaced with the weights of classifiers trained in a supervised manner. This increases the discrimination power of the speech classifier constantly during the adversarial training, motivating the model to generate latent representations in which speech is not distinguishable, even using new speech classifiers trained outside the adversarial training loop. The proposed method is evaluated against a baseline approach with no privacy measures and a prior adversarial training method, demonstrating a significant reduction in privacy violations compared to the baseline approach. Additionally, we show that the prior adversarial method is practically ineffective for this purpose.",

STFT phase globally appears as uniformly distributed, which has led researchers in this field to model it as a uniform random variable. However, some information about the phase can be obtained from a sinusoidal model, which reveals its local structure. Therefore, we propose to model the phase with a von Mises (VM) random variable, which enables us to favor the sinusoidal model-based phase value. We estimate the distribution parameters and we validate this model on real audio data. In particular, we observe that both models (uniform and VM) are relevant from a statistical perspective but they convey different information about the phase (global vs. local). We also apply this VM model to an audio source separation task, where it outperforms previous approaches.",

Both the ensemble and the neural network fusion of magnitude spectra obtained with these approaches have been shown to improve the objective perceptual quality with synthetic mixtures of data. This work generalizes the ensemble approach by proposing neural network layers to predict time-frequency varying weights for the combination of the two magnitude spectra. In order to combine the best individual magnitude spectrum estimates, the weight prediction network is trained after the time-frequency mask and magnitude spectrum sub-networks have been separately trained for their corresponding objectives and their weights have been frozen. Using the publicly available CHiME3 -challenge data, which consists of both simulated and real speech recordings in everyday environments with noise and interference, the proposed approach leads to significantly higher noise suppression in terms of segmental source-to-distortion ratio over the alternative approaches. In addition, the approach achieves similar improvements in the average objective instrumentally measured intelligibility scores with respect to the best achieved scores.",

    abstract = "Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||",

In this study, we propose the integration of two commonly used approaches in privacy preservation: source separation and adversarial representation learning. The proposed system learns the latent representation of audio recordings such that it prevents differentiating between speech and non-speech recordings. Initially, the source separation network filters out some of the privacy-sensitive data, and during the adversarial learning process, the system will learn privacy-preserving representation on the filtered signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing our method against systems without source separation, without adversarial learning, and without both. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed system can significantly improve speech privacy preservation compared to that of using source separation or adversarial learning solely while maintaining good performance in the acoustic monitoring task.",

Mothers of at-risk infants had proportionally less voicing, and the proportion of voicing decreased with increasing severity of the infants' long-term outcome. Follow-up analysis based on manual annotation of phonation style revealed breathy phonation as more common toward infants with more severe long-term outcomes (N=7; 44.7\\% of speech) than controls (N=14; 22.0\\%; p=0.005) or at-risk infants with typical or mildly abnormal long-term outcomes (N=7; 16.5\\%; p=0.002). The results indicate that maternal phonation style during early dyadic interactions is affected by the infant's neurological condition.",

However, little work has been done on adapting such methods to track consistently multiple sources appearing and disappearing, as would occur in reality. In this paper, we present a new training strategy for deep learning SSL models with a straightforward implementation based on the mean squared error of the optimal association between estimated and reference positions in the preceding time frames. It optimizes the desired properties of a tracking system: handling a time-varying number of sources and ordering localization estimates according to their trajectories, minimizing identity switches (IDSs). Evaluation on simulated data of multiple reverberant moving sources and on two model architectures proves its effectiveness in reducing identity switches without compromising frame-wise localization accuracy.",

For example, an automatic audio focus for video capture on a mobile phone requires robust detection of relevant acoustic events around the device and their direction. Existing SELD approaches have been evaluated using material produced in controlled indoor environments, or the audio is simulated by mixing isolated sounds to different spatial locations. This paper studies SELD of speech in diverse everyday environments, where the audio corresponds to typical usage scenarios of handheld mobile devices. In order to allow weighting the relative importance of localization vs. detection, we will propose a two-stage hierarchical system, where the first stage is to detect the target events, and the second stage is to localize them. The proposed method utilizes convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and is evaluated on a database of manually annotated microphone array recordings from various acoustic conditions. The array is embedded in a contemporary mobile phone form factor. The obtained results show good speech detection and localization accuracy of the proposed method in contrast to a non-hierarchical flat classification model.",

In this paper, we address zero-shot learning by employing factored linear and nonlinear acoustic-semantic projections. We develop factored linear projections by applying rank decomposition to a bilinear model, and use nonlinear activation functions, such as tanh, to model the non-linearity between acoustic embeddings and semantic embeddings. Compared with the prior bilinear model, experimental results show that the proposed projection methods are effective for improving classification performance of zero-shot learning in audio classification.",

This approach, in which the phase of the original mixture is assigned to each component, is limited when sources overlap in the TF domain. In this paper, we propose to improve this technique by accounting for two properties of the phase. First, we model the sources by anisotropic Gaussian variables: This model accounts for the non-uniformity of the phase, and permits us to incorporate some prior information about the phase that originates from a sinusoidal model. Second, we exploit the STFT consistency, which is the relationship between STFT coefficients that is due to the redundancy of the STFT. We derive a conjugate gradient algorithm for estimating the corresponding filter, which we refer to as the consistent anisotropic Wiener filter. Experiments conducted on music pieces show that the proposed approach yields results similar to or better than the state-of-The-Art with a dramatic reduction of the computation time.",

First, we provide an overview of sixty-six training datasets used in automatic image, video, and audio captioning, examining their compilation methods with a metadata analysis. Second, we delve into the annotation process of crowdsourced datasets with an interest in understanding the linguistic factors that affect the form and content of the captions, such as contextualization and perspectivation. With a qualitative content analysis, we examine annotator instructions with a selection of eleven datasets. Drawing from various theoretical frameworks that help assess the effectiveness of the instructions, we discuss the visual and textual presentation of the instructions, as well as the perspective-guidance that is an essential part of the language instructions. While our analysis indicates that some standards in the formulation of instructions seem to have formed in the field, we also identified various reoccurring issues potentially hindering readability and comprehensibility of the instructions, and therefore, caption quality. To enhance readability, we emphasize the importance of text structure, organization of the information, consistent use of typographical cues, and clarity of language use. Last, engaging with previous research, we assess the compilation of both web-sourced and crowdsourced captioning datasets from various perspectives, discussing factors affecting the diversity of the datasets.",

    abstract = "Decades of research has studied how language learning infants learn to discriminate speech sounds, segment words, and associate words with their meanings. While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the exact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet remains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic comprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech and concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate without prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units, and without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has raised the question whether knowledge of linguistic units, such as phone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent representations supporting the translation between speech and representations in other modalities, and instead of the units ever being proximal learning goals for the learner. In this study, formulate this idea as the so-called latent language hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review the extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing computational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning simulations with different neural network models for audiovisual cross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real speech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the networks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by utilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic selectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations. As a result, we find that representations associated with phonetic, syllabic, and lexical units of speech indeed emerge from the audiovisual learning process. The finding is also robust against variations in model architecture or characteristics of model training and testing data. The results suggest that cross-modal and cross-situational learning may, in principle, assist in early language development much beyond just enabling association of acoustic word forms to their referential meanings.",

Classical source models in the short-term Fourier transform domain use circularly-symmetric Gaussian or Poisson random variables. This is equivalent to assuming that the phase of each source is uniformly distributed, which is not suitable for exploiting the underlying structure of the phase. Drawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian source model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us to favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov chain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex Itakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of non-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a distortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which preserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables one to account for some phase constraints. We derive a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Experiments conducted on a musical source separation task in a semi-informed setting show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art phase-aware separation techniques.",

In the last years, deep learning methods have established themselves as the state-of-the-art approach for the task, using binary indicators during training to denote whether an event is active or inactive. However, such binary activity indicators do not fully describe the events, and estimating the envelope of the sounds could provide more precise modeling of their activity. This paper proposes to estimate the amplitude envelopes of target sound event classes in polyphonic mixtures. For training, we use the amplitude envelopes of the target sounds, calculated from mixture signals and, for comparison, from their isolated counterparts. The model is then used to perform envelope estimation and sound event detection. Results show that the envelope estimation allows good modeling of the sounds activity, with detection results comparable to current state-of-the art.",

    title = "Automatic Assessment of Parkinson's Disease Using Speech Representations of Phonation and Articulation",
    abstract = "Speech from people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are likely to be degraded on phonation, articulation, and prosody. Motivated to describe articulation deficits comprehensively, we investigated 1) the universal phonological features that model articulation manner and place, also known as speech attributes, and 2) glottal features capturing phonation characteristics. These were further supplemented by, and compared with, prosodic features using a popular compact feature set and standard MFCC. Temporal characteristics of these features were modeled by convolutional neural networks. Besides the features, we were also interested in the speech tasks for collecting data for automatic PD speech assessment, like sustained vowels, text reading, and spontaneous monologue. For this, we utilized a recently collected Finnish PD corpus (PDSTU) as well as a Spanish database (PC-GITA). The experiments were formulated as regression problems against expert ratings of PD-related symptoms, including ratings of speech intelligibility, voice impairment, overall severity of communication disorder on PDSTU, as well as on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) on PC-GITA. The experimental results show: 1) the speech attribute features can well indicate the severity of pathologies in parkinsonian speech; 2) combining phonation features with articulatory features improves the PD assessment performance, but requires high-quality recordings to be applicable; 3) read speech leads to more accurate automatic ratings than the use of sustained vowels, but not if the amount of speech is limited to correspond to the sustained vowels in duration; and 4) jointly using data from several speech tasks can further improve the automatic PD assessment performance.",

The 3D CNN enables the network to simultaneously learn the inter-and intra-channel features from the input multichannel audio. In order to evaluate the proposed method, multichannel audio datasets with different number of overlapping sound sources are synthesized. Each of this dataset has a four-channel first-order Ambisonic, binaural, and single-channel versions, on which the performance of SED using the proposed method are compared to study the potential of SED using multichannel audio. A similar study is also done with the binaural and single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development dataset. The proposed method learns to recognize overlapping sound events from multichannel features faster and performs better SED with a fewer number of training epochs. The results show that on using multichannel Ambisonic audio in place of single-channel audio we improve the overall F-score by 7.5\\%, overall error rate by 10\\% and recognize 15.6\\% more sound events in time frames with four overlapping sound sources.",

This challenge motivates us to address the new problem of few-shot class-incremental audio classification. This study aims to enable a model to continuously recognize new classes of sounds with a few training samples of new classes while remembering the learned ones. To this end, we propose a method to generate discriminative prototypes and use them to expand the model's classifier for recognizing sounds of new and learned classes. The model is first trained with a random episodic training strategy, and then its backbone is used to generate the prototypes. A dynamic relation projection module refines the prototypes to enhance their discriminability. Results on two datasets (derived from the corpora of Nsynth and FSD-MIX-CLIPS) show that the proposed method exceeds three state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy and performance dropping rate.",

    abstract = "Unsupervised spoken term discovery (UTD) aims at finding recurring segments of speech from a corpus of acoustic speech data. One potential approach to this problem is to use dynamic time warping (DTW) to find well-aligning patterns from the speech data. However, automatic selection of initial candidate segments for the DTW-alignment and detection of “sufficiently good” alignments among those require some type of predefined criteria, often operationalized as threshold parameters for pair-wise distance metrics between signal representations. In the existing UTD systems, the optimal hyperparameters may differ across datasets, limiting their applicability to new corpora and truly low-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic approach to DTW-based UTD named as PDTW. In PDTW, distributional characteristics of the processed corpus are utilized for adaptive evaluation of alignment quality, thereby enabling systematic discovery of pattern pairs that have similarity what would be expected by coincidence. We test PDTW on Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017 datasets as a part of 2020 implementation of the challenge. The results show that the system performs consistently on all five tested languages using fixed hyperparameters, clearly outperforming the earlier DTW-based system in terms of coverage of the detected patterns.",

However, supervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires a significant amount of training data.

Recorded datasets often lack sufficient and versatile material for supervised DNN training. On the other hand, impulse response databases allow large scale dataset creation, provided that suitable IRs are available. However, existing IR datasets do not cater to the data requirements of moving and crossing sources problem in sound localization, due to insufficient angular resolution. This work introduces a versatile room IR dataset to address this problem. Various diverse environments such as office rooms, meeting rooms, corridor, and an anechoic chamber are chosen for the data collection. The chosen rooms have varying characteristics, such as reverberation times (T60) and volumes. The data is collected by placing the speaker at three different distances from a rotated microphone array, thus mimicking the moving source condition. Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is performed by spatializing the sound signal with the collected IRs to verify their quality. The dataset will be publicly available.",

    abstract = {Background: Early neurodevelopmental care and research are in urgent need of practical methods for quantitative assessment of early motor development. Here, performance of a wearable system in early motor assessment was validated and compared to developmental tracking of physical growth charts. Methods: Altogether 1358 h of spontaneous movement during 226 recording sessions in 116 infants (age 4–19 months) were analysed using a multisensor wearable system. A deep learning-based automatic pipeline quantified categories of infants' postures and movements at a time scale of seconds. Results from an archived cohort (dataset 1, N = 55 infants) recorded under partial supervision were compared to a validation cohort (dataset 2, N = 61) recorded at infants{\textquoteright} homes by the parents. Aggregated recording-level measures including developmental age prediction (DAP) were used for comparison between cohorts. The motor growth was also compared with respective DAP estimates based on physical growth data (length, weight, and head circumference) obtained from a large cohort (N = 17,838 infants; age 4–18 months). Findings: Age-specific distributions of posture and movement categories were highly similar between infant cohorts. The DAP scores correlated tightly with age, explaining 97–99\\% (94–99\\% CI 95) of the variance at the group average level, and 80–82\\% (72–88\\%) of the variance in the individual recordings. Both the average motor and the physical growth measures showed a very strong fit to their respective developmental models (R2 = 0.99). However, single measurements showed more modality-dependent variation that was lowest for motor (σ = 1.4 [1.3–1.5 CI 95] months), length (σ = 1.5 months), and combined physical (σ = 1.5 months) measurements, and it was clearly higher for the weight (σ = 1.9 months) and head circumference (σ = 1.9 months) measurements. Longitudinal tracking showed clear individual trajectories, and its accuracy was comparable between motor and physical measures with longer measurement intervals. Interpretation: A quantified, transparent and explainable assessment of infants' motor performance is possible with a fully automated analysis pipeline, and the results replicate across independent cohorts from out-of-hospital recordings. A holistic assessment of motor development provides an accuracy that is comparable with the conventional physical growth measures. A quantitative measure of infants{\textquoteright} motor development may directly support individual diagnostics and care, as well as facilitate clinical research as an outcome measure in early intervention trials.

Current audio-caption datasets (e.g., Clotho) contain audio samples paired with annotated captions, but lack relevance information about audio samples and captions beyond the annotated ones. Besides, mainstream approaches (e.g., CLAP) usually treat the annotated pairs as positives and consider all other audio-caption combinations as negatives, assuming a binary relevance between audio samples and captions. To infer the relevance between audio samples and arbitrary captions, we propose a method that computes non-binary audio-caption relevance scores based on the textual similarities of audio captions. We measure textual similarities of audio captions by calculating the cosine similarity of their Sentence-BERT embeddings and then transform these similarities into audio-caption relevance scores using a logistic function, thereby linking audio samples through their annotated captions to all other captions in the dataset. To integrate the computed relevances into training, we employ a listwise ranking objective, where relevance scores are converted into probabilities of ranking audio samples for a given textual query. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improvements in text-based audio retrieval compared to methods that use binary audio-caption relevances for training.",

    abstract = "Researchers have hypothesized that infant language learning starts from the third trimester of pregnancy. This is supported by studies with fetuses and newborns showing discrimination/preference for their native language. Jointly with empirical research, initial computational modeling studies have investigated whether learning language patterns from speech input benefits from auditory prenatal language exposure (PLE), showing some advantages for prior adaptation to speech-like patterns. However, these modeling studies have not modeled prenatal speech input in an ecologically representative manner regarding quality or quantity. This study describes an ecologically representative framework for modeling PLE for full-term and preterm infants. The approach is based on empirical estimates of the amount of prenatal speech input together with a model of speech signal attenuation from the external air to the fetus{\textquoteright} auditory system. Using this framework, we conduct language learning simulations with computational models that learn from acoustic speech input in an unsupervised manner. We compare the effects of PLE to standard learning from only postnatal input on various early language phenomena. The results show how incorporating PLE can affect models{\textquoteright} learning outcomes, including differences between full-term and preterm conditions. Moreover, PLE duration might influence model behavior, depending on the linguistic capability being tested. While the inclusion of PLE did not improve the compatibility of the tested models with empirical infant data, our study highlights the relevance of PLE as a factor in modeling studies. Moreover, it provides a basic framework for modeling the prenatal period in future computational studies.",

    abstract = "Sound event localization and detection is a novel area of research that emerged from the combined interest of analyzing the acoustic scene in terms of the spatial and temporal activity of sounds of interest. This paper presents an overview of the first international evaluation on sound event localization and detection, organized as a task of the DCASE 2019 Challenge. A large-scale realistic dataset of spatialized sound events was generated for the challenge, to be used for training of learning-based approaches, and for evaluation of the submissions in an unlabeled subset. The overview presents in detail how the systems were evaluated and ranked and the characteristics of the best-performing systems. Common strategies in terms of input features, model architectures, training approaches, exploitation of prior knowledge, and data augmentation are discussed. Since ranking in the challenge was based on individually evaluating localization and event classification performance, part of the overview focuses on presenting metrics for the joint measurement of the two, together with a reevaluation of submissions using these new metrics. The new analysis reveals submissions that performed better on the joint task of detecting the correct type of event close to its original location than some of the submissions that were ranked higher in the challenge. Consequently, ranking of submissions which performed strongly when evaluated separately on detection or localization, but not jointly on both, was affected negatively.",

For practical purposes involving human listeners, a 20 ms algorithmic delay is the uppermost limit which is comfortable to the listener. In this paper, we propose a low-latency (algorithmic delay <20 ms) deep neural network (DNN) based source separation method. The proposed method takes advantage of an extended past context, outputting soft time-frequency masking filters which are then applied to incoming audio frames to give better separation performance as compared to NMF baseline. Acoustic mixtures from five pairs of speakers from CMU Arctic database [1] were used for the experiments. At least 1 dB average improvement in source to distortion ratios (SDR) was observed in our DNN-based system over a low-latency NMF baseline for different processing and analysis frame lengths. The effect of incorporating previous temporal context into DNN inputs yielded significant improvements in SDR for short processing frame lengths.",

It consists of three parts: a) the usage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks instead of their bidirectional variant used in the original work, b) using a short synthesis window (here 8 ms) required for low-latency operation, and, c) using a buffer in the beginning of audio mixture to estimate cluster centres corresponding to constituent speakers which are then utilized to separate speakers within the rest of the signal. The buffer duration would serve as an initialization phase after which the system is capable of operating with 8 ms algorithmic latency. We evaluate our proposed approach on two-speaker mixtures from Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus. We observe that the use of LSTM yields around one dB lower SDR as compared to the baseline bidirectional LSTM in terms of source to distortion ratio (SDR). Moreover, using an 8 ms synthesis window instead of 32 ms degrades the separation performance by around 2.1 dB as compared to the baseline. Finally, we also report separation performance with different buffer durations noting that separation can be achieved even for buffer duration as low as 300 ms.",

In the discrete case, we propose a method for computing the normalized compression distance, where we account for correlation between time series.

We evaluate our methods on two cover song identification tasks using a data set comprised of 300 Jazz standards and using the Million Song Dataset. For both datasets, we observe that continuous-valued approaches outperform discrete-valued approaches. We consider approaches to estimating the normalized compression distance (NCD) based on string compression and prediction, where we observe that our proposed normalized compression distance with alignment (NCDA) improves average performance over NCD, for sequential compression algorithms.

The most common signal enhancement techniques for microphone arrays are based on the design of directional filters or beamforming. This chapter provides a brief overview of these techniques, with a focus on post-filtering techniques. In adaptive beamformers there is a trade-off between directional selectivity and noise amplification which can be observed in the directivity factor. A class of adaptive beamformers are described as part of the informed spatial filters that combine beamforming with noise reduction. Time-frequency masking is commonly applied at the output of the beamformer to adjust the spectrum to better match that of the desired source signal. The post-filters are only capable of reducing uncorrelated or correlated noise in the beamforming output, and rely on the output of the beamformer for the suppression of the interference.",

The approach specifically addresses the challenging case of separation where no training data are available. By representing mixtures in the modulation spectrogram (MS) domain, we exploit underlying similarities in patterns present across frequency. A three-dimensional tensor factorization is able to take advantage of these redundant patterns, and is used to separate a mixture into an approximated sum of components by minimizing a divergence cost. Furthermore, we show that the basic tensor factorization can be extended with convolution in time being used to improve separation results and provide update rules to learn components in such a manner. Following factorization, sources are reconstructed in the audio domain from estimated components using a novel approach based on reconstruction masks that are learned using MS activations, and then applied to a mixture spectrogram. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior separation performance to a spectrally based nonnegative matrix factorization approach, in terms of source-to-distortion ratio. We also compare separation with the perceptually motivated interference-related perceptual score metric and identify cases with higher performance.",

    title = "Acoustic Source Localization in a Room Environment and at Moderate Distances",
    abstract = "The pressure changes of an acoustic wavefront are sensed with a microphone that acts as a transducer, converting sound pressure into voltage. The voltage is then converted into digital form with an analog to digital (AD) -converter to provide a discrete time quantized digital signal. This thesis discusses methods to estimate the location of a sound source from the signals of multiple microphones. Acoustic source localization (ASL) can be used to locate talkers, which is useful for speech communication systems such as teleconferencing and hearing aids. Active localization methods receive and send energy, whereas passive methods only receive energy. The discussed ASL methods are passive which makes them attractive for surveillance applications, such as localization of vehicles and monitoring of areas. This thesis focuses on ASL in a room environment and at moderate distances that are often present in outdoor applications. The frequency range of many commonly occurring sounds such as speech, vehicles, and jet aircraft is large. Time delay estimation (TDE) methods are suitable for estimating properties from such wideband signals. Since TDE methods have been extensively studied, the theory is attractive to apply in localization. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) -based methods estimate the source location from measured TDOA values between microphones. These methods are computationally attractive but deteriorate rapidly when the TDOA estimates are no longer directly related to the source position. In a room environment such conditions could be faced when reverberation or noise starts to dominate TDOA estimation. The combination of microphone pairwise TDE measurements is studied as a more robust localization solution. TDE measurements are combined into a spatial likelihood function (SLF) of source position. A sequential Bayesian method known as particle filtering (PF) is used to estimate the source position. The PF based localization accuracy increases when the variance of SLF decreases. Results from simulations and real-data show that multiplication (intersection operation) results in a SLF with smaller variance than the typically applied summation (union operation). The above localization methods assume that the source is located in the near-field of the microphone array, i.e., the source emitted wavefront curvature is observable. In the far-field, the source wavefront is assumed planar and localization is considered by using spatially separated direction observations. The direction of arrival (DOA) of a source emitted wavefront impinging on a microphone array is traditionally estimated by steering the array to a direction that maximizes the steered response power. Such estimates can be deteriorated by noise and reverberation. Therefore, talker localization is considered using DOA discrimination. The sound propagation delay from the source to the microphone array becomes significant at moderate distances. As a result, the directional observations from a moving sound source point behind the true source position. Omitting the propagation delay results in a biased location estimate of a moving or discontinuously emitting source. To solve this problem the propagation delay is proposed to be modeled in the estimation process. Motivated by the robustness of localization using the combination of TDE measurements, source localization by directly combining the TDE-based array steered responses is considered. This extends the near-field talker localization methods to far-field source localization. The presented propagation delay modeling is then proposed for the steered response localization. The improvement in localization accuracy by including the propagation delay is studied using a simulated moving sound source in the atmosphere. The presented indoor localization methods have been evaluated in the Classification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) 2006 and CLEAR'07 technology evaluations. In the evaluations, the performance of the proposed ASL methods was evaluated by a third party from several hours of annotated data. The data was gathered from meetings held in multiple smart rooms. According to the obtained results from CLEAR'07 development dataset (166 min) presented in this thesis, 92 \\% of speech activity in a meeting situation was located within 17 cm accuracy.",

In this work, we utilize end-to-end approach and propose to combine these two stages in a single deep neural network classifier. The feature extraction over the raw waveform is conducted by a feedforward layer block, whose parameters are initialized to extract the time-frequency representations. The feature extraction parameters are updated during training, resulting with a representation that is optimized for the specific task. This feature extraction block is followed by (and jointly trained with) a convolutional recurrent network, which has recently given state-of-the-art results in many sound recognition tasks. The proposed system does not outperform a convolutional recurrent network with fixed hand-crafted features. The final magnitude spectrum characteristics of the feature extraction block parameters indicate that the most relevant information for the given task is contained in 0 - 3 kHz frequency range, and this is also supported by the empirical results on the SED performance.",

In this work, we aim to combine the feature learning capabilities of deep architectures with the empirical knowledge of human perception.

    abstract = "In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network for joint sound event localization and detection (SELD) of multiple overlapping sound events in three-dimensional (3D) space. The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values, reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in comparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of overlapping sound events.",

The aim of the hearing loss compensation task is to transform a speech signal to increase speech intelligibility after further processing by a person with a hearing impairment, which is modeled by a hearing loss model. We propose an interpretable model called dynamic processing network, which has a structure similar to band-wise dynamic compressor. The network is differentiable, and therefore allows to learn its parameters to maximize speech intelligibility. More generic models based on convolutional layers were tested as well. The performance of the tested architectures was assessed using spectro-temporal objective index (STOI) with hearing-threshold noise and hearing aid speech intelligibility (HASPI) metrics. The dynamic processing network gave a significant improvement of STOI and HASPI in comparison to popular compressive gain prescription rule Camfit. A large enough convolutional network could outperform the interpretable model with the cost of larger computational load. Finally, a combination of the dynamic processing network with convolutional neural network gave the best results in terms of STOI and HASPI.",

This approach integrates a learnable adaptive beamformer with a convolutional recurrent neural network, allowing for joint optimization of spatial filtering and classification.

Results on the ReMASC dataset show the superiority of the approach compared to the state-of-the-art and yield substantial improvements for challenging acoustic environments. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is able to better generalize to unseen environments with respect to prior studies.",

After training, we obtain clip-caption similarity by averaging frame-word similarities and estimate event-phrase correspondences by calculating frame-phrase similarities. We evaluate the method with two cross-modal tasks: audio-caption retrieval, and phrase-based sound event detection (SED).

    abstract = "In this article, we propose a new method for joint cochannel speaker separation and recognition called adaptive-dictionary non-negative matrix deconvolution (DANMD). This method is an extension of non-negative matrix deconvolution (NMD) which models spectrogram matrix as a linear combination of dictionary elements (atoms). We propose a dictionary which is a linear combination of speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability. The dictionary is parametric and all atoms depend on a small number of parameters. The speaker-independent component and components representing speaker variability are learned from recordings of tens or hundreds of speakers. We show that the proposed method can be applied to the single-channel speech separation task where two speakers of unknown identity are to be separated. In a scenario where the unknown speakers{\textquoteright} recordings are in training dataset together with recordings of many other speakers, we show that the proposed method outperforms stacked NMD (NMD with a dictionary which contains atoms of all speakers in the dataset) in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). DANMD was also tested in a scenario where recordings of the recognized speakers were not in the training dataset. In this case it brought clearly positive signal-to-distortion ratios. The proposed model was also tested for a co-channel speaker identification task, where the parameters of the adapted model are a basis for a decision about the identity of the speakers in the mixture. In this case, the accuracy was 81.2 in comparison to 84.1 in the case of stacked NMD. While the speaker recognition accuracy is lower for the new approach, we find the primary value in the improved SDR.",

We test our model and a previously proposed model in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the se- mantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models.

    title = "The effect of F0 measurements on prosody analysis in language development studies",
    abstract = "Prosodic research on child-directed speech (CDS) usually focuses on measurements of F0 mean and standard deviation (SD). In general, there is an agreement that CDS has higher pitch mean and variability than ADS (adult-directed speech). However, earlier studies have reported conflicting findings on how F0 of CDS changes with the recipient child{\textquoteright}s age, as there is evidence for both presence and absence of age-related change of pitch variability. One possibility is that the disagreement might originate from the variability of speech behaviors of speakers in different languages and cultures. Alternatively, it could be explained by the F0 measurement methodology as well. In this work, we investigate how the way we measure F0 influences the overall results on CDS change with child age. We investigated two different factors which could influence melodic analysis of speech: a) what sound segments are used to measure F0: vowels, sonorants, voiced obstruents, no account for sound segments; and b) whether the number of words within an utterance is taken into account in the analysis. We used a dataset of maternal utterances from the Providence Corpus (a collection of twice-monthly recordings of hour-long mother-child spontaneous interactions from six NA-English-speaking children) addressed at children in the age range of 1;0 to 3;0. The F0 values were calculated using OpenSMILE toolkit. The transcription-to-speech alignment was performed using WebMAUS online toolkit. The age-dependency of F0 feature was tested by means of the Spearman{\textquoteright}s rank correlation coefficient between quantized child age and the feature values associated with the age bin. The results show that the estimation procedure can affect the findings, potentially affecting developmental interpretations. In case of calculating F0 on either voiced consonants and vowels, or vowels only, there is a significant age-dependent increase of F0 SD. This is in contrast to the case of using all F0 values calculated within an utterance by F0 detection algorithm, when no significant age-dependency for F0 SD is found. Thus, it matters whether we take into account segments that are known to have proper voicing or measure F0 from all speech that an automatic F0 estimator considers as voiced irrespectively of the underlying segments. Second, we found no age-related dependencies of F0 SD (whether we took sound segment identities into account or not) for the scenario where the analysis was controlled for the number of words within an utterance, i.e. comparing one-word utterances across all ages, two-word utterances across all ages, etc. The revealed age-dependency of F0 SD for the first scenario might be explained constantly increasing length of utterances in CDS in terms of number of pronounced words along with a child age. This is since the number of pronounced words in an utterance might influence melodic variability within the utterance, where more complex intonational structure may be required to prosodically structure the longer utterances.",

    abstract = "In the previous decade, dozens of studies involving thousands of children across several research disciplines have made use of a combined daylong audio-recorder and automated algorithmic analysis called the LENAⓇ system, which aims to assess children{\textquoteright}s language environment. While the system{\textquoteright}s prevalence in the language acquisition domain is steadily growing, there are only scattered validation efforts on only some of its key characteristics. Here, we assess the LENAⓇ system{\textquoteright}s accuracy across all of its key measures: speaker classification, Child Vocalization Counts (CVC), Conversational Turn Counts (CTC), and Adult Word Counts (AWC). Our assessment is based on manual annotation of clips that have been randomly or periodically sampled out of daylong recordings, collected from (a) populations similar to the system{\textquoteright}s original training data (North American English-learning children aged 3-36 months), (b) children learning another dialect of English (UK), and (c) slightly older children growing up in a different linguistic and socio-cultural setting (Tsimane{\textquoteright} learners in rural Bolivia). We find reasonably high accuracy in some measures (AWC, CVC), with more problematic levels of performance in others (CTC, precision of male adults and other children). Statistical analyses do not support the view that performance is worse for children who are dissimilar from the LENAⓇ original training set. Whether LENAⓇ results are accurate enough for a given research, educational, or clinical application depends largely on the specifics at hand. We therefore conclude with a set of recommendations to help researchers make this determination for their goals.",

    abstract = "Infant motility assessment using intelligent wearables is a promising new approach for assessment of infant neurophysiological development, and where efficient signal analysis plays a central role. This study investigates the use of different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant motility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and computational burden of alternative sensor encoder and time series modeling modules and their combinations. In addition, we explore the benefits of data augmentation methods in ideal and nonideal recording conditions. The experiments are conducted using a dataset of multisensor movement recordings from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the best performance was obtained with parallel two-dimensional convolutions for intrasensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier performance. Comparison of time series models revealed that feedforward dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance.

    abstract = "This thesis concerns the problem of automatic transcription of music and proposes a method for transcribing monophonic melodies. Recently, computational music content analysis has received considerable attention among researchers due to the rapid growth of music databases. In this area of research, melody transcription plays an important role. Automatic melody transcription can beneﬁt professional musicians and provide interesting applications for consumers, including music retrieval and interactive music applications. The proposed method is based on two probabilistic models: a note event model and a musicological model. The note event model is used to represent note candidates in melodies, and it is based on hidden Markov models. The note event model is trained with an acoustic database of singing sequences, but the training can be done for any melodic instrument and for the desired front-end feature extractors. The musicological model is used to control the transitions between the note candidates by using musical key estimation and by computing the likelihoods of note sequences. The two models are combined to constitute a melody transcription system with a modular architecture. The transcription system is evaluated, and the results are good. Our system transcribes correctly over 90 \% of notes, thus halving the amount of errors compared to a simple rounding of pitch estimates to the nearest MIDI note numbers. Particularly, using the note event model signiﬁcantly improves the system performance.",

    abstract = "Transcription of music refers to the analysis of a music signal in order to produce a parametric representation of the sounding notes in the signal. This is conventionally carried out by listening to a piece of music and writing down the symbols of common musical notation to represent the occurring notes in the piece. Automatic transcription of music refers to the extraction of such representations using signal-processing methods. This thesis concerns the automatic transcription of pitched notes in musical audio and its applications. Emphasis is laid on the transcription of realistic polyphonic music, where multiple pitched and percussive instruments are sounding simultaneously. The methods included in this thesis are based on a framework which combines both low-level acoustic modeling and high-level musicological modeling. The emphasis in the acoustic modeling has been set to note events so that the methods produce discrete-pitch notes with onset times and durations as output. Such transcriptions can be efficiently represented as MIDI files, for example, and the transcriptions can be converted to common musical notation via temporal quantization of the note onsets and durations. The musicological model utilizes musical context and trained models of typical note sequences in the transcription process. Based on the framework, this thesis presents methods for generic polyphonic transcription, melody transcription, and bass line transcription. A method for chord transcription is also presented. All the proposed methods have been extensively evaluated using realistic polyphonic music. In our evaluations with 91 half-a-minute music excerpts, the generic polyphonic transcription method correctly found 39\% of all the pitched notes (recall) where 41\% of the transcribed notes were correct (precision). Despite the seemingly low recognition rates in our simulations, this method was top-ranked in the polyphonic note tracking task in the international MIREX evaluation in 2007 and 2008. The methods for the melody, bass line, and chord transcription were evaluated using hours of music, where F-measure of 51\% was achieved for both melodies and bass lines. The chord transcription method was evaluated using the first eight albums by The Beatles and it produced correct frame-based labeling for about 70\% of the time. The transcriptions are not only useful as human-readable musical notation but in several other application areas too, including music information retrieval and content-based audio modification. This is demonstrated by two applications included in this thesis. The first application is a query by humming system which is capable of searching melodies similar to a user query directly from commercial music recordings. In our evaluation with a database of 427 full commercial audio recordings, the method retrieved the correct recording in the topthree list for the 58\% of 159 hummed queries. The method was also top-ranked in “query by singing/humming” task in MIREX 2008 for a database of 2048 MIDI melodies and 2797 queries. The second application uses automatic melody transcription for accompaniment and vocals separation. The transcription also enables tuning the user singing to the original melody in a novel karaoke application.",

    abstract = "Text-to-phoneme (TTP) mapping, also called grapheme-to-phoneme (GTP) conversion, defines the process of transforming a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Text-to-phoneme mapping is a necessary step in any state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) system, where the textual information changes dynamically (i.e., new contact entries for name dialing, or new short messages or emails to be read out by a device). There are significant differences between the implementation requirements of a text-to-phoneme mapping module embedded into the automatic speech recognition and into the text-to-speech systems: in automatic speech recognition systems the errors of the text-to-phoneme mapping module are tolerated better (leading to occasional recognition errors) than in the text-to-speech applications, where the effect is immediately and in all cases audible. Automatic speech recognition systems typically use text-to-phoneme mapping to lower the footprint (to avoid storing the lexicon), while maintaining quality. The use of text-to-phoneme mapping in the text-to-speech systems is different. In addition to the phonetic information, the text-to-speech systems also need prosodic information to be able to produce high quality speech, which cannot be predicted by text-to-phoneme mapping. Most state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems use explicit pronunciation lexicon, which is aimed at providing the widest possible coverage, in the order of 100K words, with high quality pronunciation information. Because of this reason, text-to-phoneme mapping is typically used as a fall-back strategy, when the system encounters very rare or non-native words and the quality of a ext-to-speech system is indirectly affected by the quality of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Another important issue is the question of training the text-to-phoneme mapping module. The problem of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is a static one and such a system is trained off-line. The correspondence between the written and spoken form of a language is usually unchanged in the lifetime of an application. So the complexity/speed of the model training is of secondary importance compared to e.g., the speed of convergence or model size. In this thesis, the problem of text-to-phoneme mapping using neural networks is studied. One of the main goals of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of different neural network structures which can be implemented to convert a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Another important target, of this work, is to provide new solutions that improve the performance of the existing algorithms, in terms of convergence speed and phoneme accuracy. Three main neural network classes are studied in this thesis: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). Due to their ability of self adaptation, neural networks have been shown to be a viable solution in applications that require modeling abilities. Such an application is the text-tophoneme mapping where the correspondence between letters of a written text and their corresponding phonetic transcription must be modeled. One of the main concerns in all practical implementations, where neural networks are used, is to develop algorithms which provide fast convergence of the synaptic weights and in the same time good mapping performances. When a neural network is trained for text-to-phoneme mapping, at every iteration, a letter-phoneme pair is presented to the network such that, the number of letters and the number of training iterations are equal. As a result, fast convergence of the neural network means smaller size of the training dictionary since fast convergence is in fact similar to less necessary training letters1. A fast convergence speed is important in applications where only a small linguistic database is available. Of course, one solution could be to use a small dictionary (with very few words) which is presented at the input of the neural network many times until the convergence of the synaptic weights is reached. In this case the time of training becomes more important. Taking into account these two sides of the convergence speed (the size of the training dictionary and the processing time during training) one can understand the importance of having algorithms that ensure fast convergence of the neural network. It is well known that the error back-propagation algorithm which is used to train the MLP neural network, possess sometimes a quite slow convergence (a very large number of iterations required to reach the stability point). In order to increase the convergence speed two novel alternative solutions are proposed in this thesis: one using an adaptive learning rate in the training process and another which is a transform domain implementation of the multilayer perceptron neural network. The computational complexity of the two proposed training algorithms is slightly higher than the computational complexity of the error back-propagation algorithm but the number of training iterations is highly reduced. Due to this fact, although the three algorithms might have the same training time, the novel algorithms necessitate smaller training dictionary. Due to the limitations of the processing power that usually are encountered in real devices, another very important requirement for a text-to-phoneme mapping system is to have low computational and memory costs. In the case of text-to-phoneme mapping systems based in neural networks, the computational complexity is mainly linked to the mathematical complexity of the training algorithm as well as to the number of the synaptic weights of the neural network. Memory load is due to the number of synaptic weights of the neural network which must be stored. Taking into account all these limitations and implementation requirements, in this thesis, several neural network structures with different number of synaptic weights and trained with various training algorithms, are studied. The modeling capability of the neural networks is addressed, which is translated in the text-to-phoneme mapping case into the phoneme accuracy. Different neural network structures, training algorithms and network complexities are analyzed also from this point of view. As a remark here, we mention that input letter encoding plays a very important role in the phoneme accuracy of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system. This is why special attention has been paid to the comparative analysis of the performances (in terms of phoneme accuracy) obtained with several orthogonal and non-orthogonal encoding of the input letters. The thesis is structured into four main parts. Chapter 1 brings the reader into the world of text-to-phoneme mapping. In Chapter 2 several different neural network structures and their corresponding training algorithms are described and two new training algorithms are introduced and analyzed. In Chapter 3 the experimental results, for the problem of monolingual text-to-phoneme mapping, obtained with the neural networks described in Chapter 2 are shown. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the problem of bilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and Chapter 5 concludes the thesis.",

Experimental material consisted of 5286 single notes from Western orchestral instruments, the timbre of which have been studied in great depth. The literature review part of this thesis introduces the studies on the sound of musical instruments, as well as related knowledge on instrument acoustics. Together with the state-of-the-art in automatic sound source recognition systems, these form the foundation for the most important part of this thesis: the extraction of perceptually relevant features from acoustic musical signals. Several different feature extraction algorithms were implemented and developed, and used as a front-end for a pattern recognition system. The performance of the system was evaluated in several experiments. Using feature vectors that included cepstral coefﬁcients and features relating to the type of excitation, brightness, modulations, asynchronity and fundamental frequency of tones, an accuracy of 35 \% was obtained on a database including several examples of 29 instruments. The recognition of the family of the instrument between six possible classes was successful in 77 \% of the cases. The performance of the system and the confusions it made were compared to the results reported for human perception. The comparison shows that the performance of the system is worse than that of humans in a similar task (46 \% in individual instrument and 92 \% in instrument family recognition [Martin99]), although it is comparable to the performance of other reported systems. Confusions of the system resemble those of human subjects, indicating that the feature extraction algorithms have managed to capture perceptually relevant information from the acoustic signals.",

    abstract = "Signal processing methods for audio classification and music content analysis are developed in this thesis. Audio classification is here understood as the process of assigning a discrete category label to an unknown recording. Two specific problems of audio classification are considered: musical instrument recognition and context recognition. In the former, the system classifies an audio recording according to the instrument, e.g. violin, flute, piano, that produced the sound. The latter task is about classifying an environment, such a car, restaurant, or library, based on its ambient audio background. In the field of music content analysis, methods are presented for music meter analysis and chorus detection. Meter analysis methods consider the estimation of the regular pattern of strong and weak beats in a piece of music. The goal of chorus detection is to locate the chorus segment in music which is often the catchiest and most memorable part of a song. These are among the most important and readily commercially applicable content attributes that can be automatically analyzed from music signals. For audio classification, several features and classification methods are proposed and evaluated. In musical instrument recognition, we consider methods to improve the performance of a baseline audio classification system that uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and their first derivatives as features, and continuous-density hidden Markov models (HMMs) for modeling the feature distributions. Two improvements are proposed to increase the performance of this baseline system. First, transforming the features to a base with maximal statistical independence using independent component analysis. Secondly, discriminative training is shown to further improve the recognition accuracy of the system. For musical meter analysis, three methods are proposed. The first performs meter analysis jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level, which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. The features obtained from an accent feature analyzer and a bank of combfilter resonators are processed by a novel probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and performs joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses. The second method focuses on estimating the beat and the tatum. The design goal was to keep the method computationally very efficient while retaining sufficient analysis accuracy. Simplified probabilistic modeling is proposed for beat and tatum period and phase estimation, and ensuring the continuity of the estimates. A novel phase-estimator based on adaptive comb filtering is presented. The accuracy of the method is close to the first method but with a fraction of the computational cost. The third method for music rhythm analysis focuses on improving the accuracy in music tempo estimation. The method is based on estimating the tempo of periodicity vectors using locally weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression. Regression closely relates to classification, the difference being that the goal of regression is to estimate the value of a continuous variable (the tempo), whereas in classification the value to be assigned is a discrete category label. We propose a resampling step applied to an unknown periodicity vector before finding the nearest neighbors to increase the likelihood of finding a good match from the training set. This step improves the performance of the method significantly. The tempo estimate is computed as a distance-weighted median of the nearest neighbor tempi. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significantly better tempo estimation accuracies than three reference methods. Finally, we describe a computationally efficient method for detecting a chorus section in popular and rock music. The method utilizes a self-dissimilarity representation that is obtained by summing two separate distance matrices calculated using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient and pitch chroma features. This is followed by the detection of off-diagonal segments of small distance in the distance matrix. From the detected segments, an initial chorus section is selected using a scoring mechanism utilizing several heuristics, and subjected to further processing.",

    abstract = "An acoustic environment surrounding a listener, an auditory scene, can provide contextual cues that enable the recognition of the scene. This thesis concerns the problem of computational auditory scene recognition, which is a subproblem of computational auditory scene analysis. Computational auditory scene analysis refers to the computational analysis of an acoustic environment, and the recognition of distinct sound events in it. In this study, the focus is not in analyzing and recognizing discrete sound events (although they may be used in the recognition process), but in the classiﬁcation of acoustic environments as whole. This thesis covers all the different phases of a study that was made at the Signal Processing Laboratory of Tampere University of Technology: a literature review on auditory scene recognition and related ﬁelds of research, acoustic measurements that were made in a number of everyday auditory environments, design and implementation of the audio database access software, a listening test examining human abilities in auditory scene recognition, audio signal classiﬁcation theory, algorithm development and simulations. The core of this thesis is in the computational audio classiﬁcation and signal processing algorithm development part. Auditory scene recognition involves correct grouping of similar environments, feature selection and extraction, and the use of a suitable classiﬁcation algorithm. A crucial step in solving the problem is to determine appropriate features that can discriminatebetween the acoustic data associated with pre-deﬁned scene classes. The conducted listening tests show that, on average, humans are able to recognize 25 different scenes with 70 \% accuracy. The scenes included everyday outside and inside environments,such as streets, market places, restaurants, and family homes. The performance of the computational classiﬁcation methods was investigated by conducting Matlab simulations. The bestobtained recognition rate for 13 different scenes was 56\%, where the classiﬁed scenes wereselected so that from each one there were at least three recordings from different locations. We also did an experiment of recognizing more general classes (meta-classes), and for certain categorizations of the scenes we obtained relatively good classiﬁcation results. For example, themeta-class car vs. other was classiﬁed correctly in 95\% of the cases.",

    abstract = "The interest in modulation classification has recently emerged in the research of communication systems. This has been due to the advances in reconfigurable signal processing systems, especially in the study of software radio. Published methods can be divided into two groups: maximum likelihood and pattern recognition approaches. In the maximum likelihood approach, decision rules are often simple but the test statistics are complicated and assume prior knowledge about the signals. In the pattern recognition approach, decision rules are often complicated whereas the features are simple and fast to calculate. Communication signals contain a vast amount of uncertainty due to the unknown modulating signal, modulation type, and noise. Therefore the modulation classification problem has to be approached by using statistical methods. The features and the test statistics may be derived from the known statistical characteristics of the modulated signals. Either implicit or explicit use of higher-order statistics has been studied previously in many communication applications. The higher-order statistics are often more preferable because second-order statistics suppress the phase information of the signal. Nevertheless, the estimation of the higher-order statistics requires long sample sets and has a high computational complexity. To overcome these problems, second-order cyclostationary statistics have been studied and the results seem promising. In this thesis, the feature extraction problem of the modulation classification is discussed. Useful characteristics and representations of the communication signals are presented as well as the relevant knowledge of statistical signal processing. The previous methods are presented in a literature review of the modulation classification. The first and second-order statistics including the cyclostationary statistics of digital modulated signals are studied, and a novel feature is proposed. Some previous methods and this novel feature are compared by investigating their discrimination performance in Matlab simulations.",

VAD is assumed to give additional information to the ASR system about the presence of speech, thus increasing the robustness of the ASR system. Two standard VAD algorithms (G.729b and GSM) are described and a statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based VAD is introduced. For the GMM based VAD, different adaptation techniques are employed to track the changing background noise statistics. The VAD algorithms are integrated with the ASR system, with explicit and implicit approaches. The explicit approach means that the VAD is a separate module in the front end of the ASR system, while in the implicit approach the VAD decision is included in the decoding stage of the speech recognition unit. The performance of the VAD algorithms are compared directly using frame classification rates and indirectly using recognition rates. Recognition is performed as a small vocabulary isolated word recognition task with a Hidden Model based ASR system using normalized Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. According to our simulations, ideal information about the word boundaries increases significantly the recognition accuracy of the ASR system.

The principal feature used are the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, but also other feature sets are considered including the spectral slope and the fundamental frequency.The work concentrates mostly on different classification algorithms used in speaker recognition. The biggest attention is on the Gaussian mixture speaker models (GMM) which have been widely used in many text-independent speaker recognition studies. Conventionally, the GMM parameters are trained with the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. An identification accuracy of 95.8\% is achieved using this method for a population of 25 speakers with 60 seconds of training speech and a test sequence of 5 seconds.A drawback of the conventional EM training is the need for selecting the number of the mixture components, i.e. the model order, before the actual training procedure. Moreover, the number of components is usually the same for each speaker. The most important part of this thesis concerns simultaneous order selection and parameter training of GMMs. We evaluate a couple of recently proposed algorithms capable of selecting the order of each speaker model individually during a single training procedure. The algorithms provide a straightforward way of adjusting the number of components of each GMM to the acoustic characteristics and amount of available training data for each speaker. The methods are based on integrating some model complexity criterion, such as the minimum descripition length, into the EM training process. It is observed that when the amount of available training data varies between speakers, a relative reduction of 13\% in error rate is obtained using an algorithm proposed by Figueiredo and Jain [Figueiredo02]. If the speech samples are recorded over a telephone line, a reduction of 11\% in error rate is observed using the agglomerative EM algorithm [Figueiredo99].",

The proposed probabilistic model consisted of three parts operating in parallel: a pitch trajectory model, a musicological model, and a duration model. The first handled imperfections in the performed/estimated pitch values using a hidden Markov model, the second estimated the musical key signature to improve the transcription accuracy ant the last models the duration of the notes. The thesis covered a literature review on human voice production and on the theory of pitch estimation. In addition, an inspection of an acoustic database recorded for the training and the testing of the proposed model was introduced.

    abstract = "Collections of digital music have become increasingly common over the recent years. As the amount of data increases, digital content management is becoming more important. In this thesis, we are studying content-based classification of acoustic musical signals according to their musical genre (e.g., classical, rock) and the instruments used. A listening experiment is conducted to study human abilities to recognise musical genres. This thesis covers a literature review on human musical genre recognition, state-of-the-art musical genre recognition systems, and related fields of research. In addition, a general-purpose music database consisting of recordings and their manual annotations is introduced. The theory behind the used features and classifiers is reviewed and the results from the simulations are presented. The developed musical genre recognition system uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to represent the time-varying magnitude spectrum of a music signal. The class-conditional feature densities are modelled with hidden Markov models. Musical instrument detection for a few pitched instruments from music signals is also studied using the same structure. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a method for the detection of drum instruments. The presence of drums is determined based on the periodicity of the amplitude envelopes of the signal at subbands. The conducted listening experiment shows that the recognition of musical genres is not a trivial task even for humans. On the average, humans are able to recognise the correct genre in 75 \% of cases (given five-second samples). Results also indicate that humans can do rather accurate musical genre recognition without long-term temporal features, such as rhythm. For the developed automatic recognition system, the obtained recognition accuracy for six musical genres was around 60 \%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems. Detection accuracy of 81 \% was obtained with the proposed drum instrument detection method.",

    abstract = "This thesis proposes algorithms to be utilized for iterative design of linear filters and for adaptive polynomial filtering. The goal is to improve existing algorithms in terms of filtering performance, time and complexity requirements. First, a family of fast algorithms suitable for adaptive polynomial filtering, namely LS-LMS algorithm and its square root variants, is introduced and its connection with the family of RLS algorithms is analyzed. The algorithms are derived by combining the triangularization and backsolving steps of QR-RLS algorithm. In the derivation we allow a modification of the cost function in order to decrease the complexity of the algorithm from O(M^2) to O(M), where M is the number of filter parameters. Second, adaptive filtering algorithms are proposed for the problem of acoustic echo control in the case of strong acoustic distortion in the loudspeaker that decreases the echo attenuation obtained using adaptive linear filtering algorithms in echo cancelers. Several existing algorithms were tested using both linear and homogeneous Volterra filters, but their performance was not found satisfactory either in terms of performance or complexity. A polynomial preprocessor followed by a linear filter was found to perform well when the preprocessor was adapted by the robust, but computationally demanding, QR-RLS algorithm and the linear part was adapted by the normalized LMS algorithm. Third, the problem of optimum energy compaction for FIR and IIR filters is addressed. The analytical method for optimum compaction FIR filter design is analyzed and shown to provide a very fast algorithm under certain conditions. For the design of optimum compaction IIR filters two new methods are proposed. The first design method operates with the numerator and the denominator in the causal part of the associated product filter, which are in turn optimized via iterative relaxations. The second method is similar, except that the angles of the poles are set to fixed values, situated at the transitions in the frequency representation of the corresponding ideal brickwall filter. Thus, the second method is faster than the first, and, moreover, it was observed that when the ideal brickwall filter does not have too many transitions, the second method provides filters with better performance. Both methods make use of semidefinite programming optimization using an appropriate parameterization of positive real polynomials. The last part of the thesis provides contributions to the frequency selective IIR filter design. The frequency response of the filter is fitted to an ideal frequency response by optimizing either a weighted sum of magnitude squares (least squares) criterion or a minimax (Chebyshev) criterion. For the least squares criterion a new convex stability domain is used and experimental evidence is given that the best designs are usually obtained with a multistage algorithm where three methods, Steiglitz-McBride, Gauss-Newton and classical descent, are used consecutively in that order. The result of multistage least squares IIR design is used to initialize the optimization procedure based on a Chebyshev criterion, for which a simplified iterative procedure is proposed. In the simplified procedure only the numerator is updated after initialization. The simplified procedure is compared experimentally with the complete procedure and the results show only very small differences in the criterion.",

    abstract = "This thesis proposes signal processing methods for the analysis of musical audio on two time scales: drum transcription on a ﬁner time scale and music structure analysis on the time scale of entire pieces. The former refers to the process of locating drum sounds in the input and recognising the instruments that were used to produce the sounds. The latter refers to the temporal segmentation of a musical piece into parts, such as chorus and verse. For drum transcription, both low-level acoustic recognition and high-level musicological modelling methods are presented. A baseline acoustic recognition method with a large number of features using Gaussian mixture models for the recognition of drum combinations is presented. Since drums occur in structured patterns, modelling of the sequential dependencies with N-grams is proposed. In addition to the conventional N-grams, periodic N-grams are proposed to model the dependencies between events that occur one pattern length apart. The evaluations show that incorporating musicological modelling improves the performance considerably. As some drums are more probable to occur at certain points in a pattern, this dependency is utilised for producing transcriptions of signals produced with arbitrary sounds, such as beatboxing. A supervised source separation method using non-negative matrix factorisation is proposed for transcribing mixtures of drum sounds. Despite the simple signal model, a high performance is obtained for signals without other instruments. Most of the drum transcription methods operate only on single-channel inputs, but multichannel signals are available in recording studios. A multichannel extension of the source separation method is proposed, and an increase in performance is observed in evaluations. Many of the drum transcription methods rely on detecting sound onsets for the segmentation of the signal. Detection errors will then decrease the overall performance of the system. To overcome this problem, a method utilising a network of connected hidden Markov models is proposed to perform the event segmentation and recognition jointly. The system is shown to be able to perform the transcription even from polyphonic music. The second main topic of this thesis is music structure analysis. Two methods are proposed for this purpose. The ﬁrst relies on deﬁning a cost function for a description of the repeated parts. The second method deﬁnes a ﬁtness function for descriptions covering the entire piece. The abstract cost (and ﬁtness) functions are formulated in terms that can be determined from the input signal algorithmically, and optimisation problems are formulated. In both cases, an algorithm is proposed for solving the optimisation problems. The ﬁrst method is evaluated on a small data set, and the relevance of the cost function terms is shown. The latter method is evaluated on three large data sets with a total of 831 (557+174+100) songs. This is to date the largest evaluation of a structure analysis method. The evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms a reference system on two of the data sets. Music structure analysis methods rarely provide musically meaningful names for the parts in the result. A method is proposed to label the parts in descriptions based on a statistical model of the sequential dependencies between musical parts. The method is shown to label the main parts relatively reliably without any additional information. The labelling model is further integrated into the ﬁtness function based structure analysis method.",

    abstract = "This thesis concerns the development and evaluation of signal processing methods that compensate for the hearing disorders caused by ageing. The global ageing increases the number of elderly people with hearing impairment. In most cases this impairment is irrecoverable and cannot be medically or surgically treated. The only option is to process the sound going to the ear, so that it would be as clear and intelligible as possible. The multichannel dynamic compression is such a processing. With the multichannel compression the need for amplified sound and the problems of redused dynamic range can be solved. The compression reduces the loudness fluctuations in the sound so that when sound is amplified, loud sounds do not sound too loud. As a degree of the hearing impairment is more severe in high frequency bands and by processing the bands individually. In this work, I have implemented a three- channel dynamic compression system controllable in real-time. The system was used to conduct listening tests for hearing impaired: The goal was to found a relationship between the audiogram (which represents the hearing threshold level and uncomfortable listening level measured by using sinusoids as stimuli) and the parameters of the multichannel dynamic compression system. In the first listening test, only a week relationship between the two was found. A second test was conducted in order to find out if the adjusted parameter were actually the most intelligible. This was realised using a paired comparison test. In this tests, four different processing were compared. The results shows that the spectral shaping was judged to be the processing which made speech the most intelligible. The compression was disliked and the possible reason for this is that the stimuli were very intelligible and power-normalised already before processing. There was no room for further improvement in intelligibility and thus the distortions caused by compression were perceived unpleasant",

    abstract = "This thesis studies several data decomposition algorithms for obtaining an object-based representation of an audio signal. The estimation of the representation parameters are coupled with audio-specific criteria, such as the spectral redundancy, sparsity, perceptual relevance and spatial position of sounds. The objective is to obtain an audio signal representation that is composed of meaningful entities called audio objects that reflect the properties of real-world sound objects and events. The estimation of the object-based model is based on magnitude spectrogram redundancy using non-negative matrix factorization with extensions to multichannel and complex-valued data. The benefits of working with object-based audio representations over the conventional time-frequency bin-wise processing are studied. The two main applications of the object-based audio representations proposed in this thesis are spatial audio coding and sound source separation from multichannel microphone array recordings. In the proposed spatial audio coding algorithm, the audio objects are estimated from the multichannel magnitude spectrogram. The audio objects are used for recovering the content of each original channel from a single downmixed signal, using time-frequency filtering. The perceptual relevance of modeling the audio signal is considered in the estimation of the parameters of the object-based model, and the sparsity of the model is utilized in encoding its parameters. Additionally, a quantization of the model parameters is proposed that reflects the perceptual relevance of each quantized element. The proposed object-based spatial audio coding algorithm is evaluated via listening tests and comparing the overall perceptual quality to conventional time-frequency block-wise methods at the same bitrates. The proposed approach is found to produce comparable coding efficiency while providing additional functionality via the object-based coding domain representation, such as the blind separation of the mixture of sound sources in the encoded channels. For the sound source separation from multichannel audio recorded by a microphone array, a method combining an object-based magnitude model and spatial covariance matrix estimation is considered. A direction of arrival-based model for the spatial covariance matrices of the sound sources is proposed. Unlike the conventional approaches, the estimation of the parameters of the proposed spatial covariance matrix model ensures a spatially coherent solution for the spatial parameterization of the sound sources. The separation quality is measured with objective criteria and the proposed method is shown to improve over the state-of-the-art sound source separation methods, with recordings done using a small microphone array.",

Sinusoids plus noise model is a spectral model, in which the periodic components of the sound are represented with sinusoids with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes and phases. The remaining non-periodic components are represented with a ﬁltered noise. The sinusoidal model utilizes the physical properties of musical instruments and the noise model the humans’ inability to perceive the exact spectral shape or phase of stochastic signals. In the case of polyphonic music signals, the estimation of the parameters of sinusoids is a difficult task, since the periodic components are usually not stable. A sufficient time and frequency resolution is also difficult to achieve at the same time. A big part of this thesis discusses the detection and parameter estimation of periodic components with several algorithms. In addition to already existing algorithms, a new iterative algorithm is presented, which is based on the fusion of closely spaced sinusoids. The sinusoidal model is applied in the separation of overlapping sounds and manipulation. In the sound separation, a new perceptual distance measure between sinusoids is used. The perceptual distance measure is based on the humans’ way to associate spectral components into sound sources. Also a new separation method based on the multipitch estimation is explained. The modification of the pitch and time scale of sounds with the sinusoid plus noise model without affecting the quality of the sound is explained shortly, too.",

    abstract = "Personal multimedia databases contain thousands of items and other databases on the Internet may contain even billions of items. Finding a particular item manually from such databases becomes overwhelming and thus automatic search engines are required to lighten the job. Query by example refers to automatically finding multimedia items from a database, which are similar to the example provided by the user. This is an important task in modern multimedia databases. This thesis deals with automatic query by example of audio samples. The emphasis is on representation and distance measures between two audio signals, which are used to estimate the similarity between these two signals. The thesis also covers computational issues, which are highly important when it comes to practical implementation of the algorithms. Two different audio signal representations are proposed. These representations are interconnected, since the first separates drums from a polyphonic music signal although the same approach could be used to separate other parts of the original signal as well, for example, harmonic instruments. The second representation models the harmonic sound using only a few parameters. The proposed method is based on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, which are further modeled using attack-decay-sustain-release curves with temporal evolution of harmonic instruments. Most distance measures, used in audio signal processing, are based on dividing a signal into frames, extracting perceptually motivated features from each frame, and calculating the distance between the features. Most of the proposed distance measures use Gaussian mixture models to estimate the probability density functions of the framewise features and calculate the distance between the Gaussian mixture models. However, the thesis also introduces a parameter free distance measurement. This is based on compression ratios of audio signals and i hence it removes the user influence on the results, since no features or other parameters need to be set. In a query by example application, the similarity between the example provided by the user and each database item need to be calculated in order to obtain a ranked list of database samples. However, in practical applications this operation is very time-consuming if the database contains millions of items. The proposed method applies keysample transformation to reduce the series of feature vectors, used to represent each signal, into a single feature vector. The database is then clustered and the search is restricted to only a few clusters, thus saving retrieval time with some loss of accuracy.",

We propose a novel multichannel NMF model with time-varying mixing of the sources denoted by spatial covariance matrices (SCM) and provide update equations for optimizing model parameters minimizing squared Frobenius norm. The SCMs of the model are obtained based on estimated directions of arrival of tracked sources at each time frame. The evaluation is based on established objective separation criteria and using real recordings of two and three simultaneous moving sound sources. The compared methods include conventional beamforming and ideal ratio mask separation. The proposed method is shown to exceed the separation quality of other evaluated blind approaches according to all measured quantities. Additionally, we evaluate the method's susceptibility towards tracking errors by comparing the separation quality achieved using annotated ground truth source trajectories.",

    abstract = "Voice conversion is a speech technology encompassing transformations applied to the speech signal with the purpose of changing the perceived speaker identity from a source voice to a desired target voice. The principal use of voice conversion is to enable synthesis systems to generate speech with customized voices without need for exhaustive recordings and processing. Voice conversion can be realized as a stand-alone task or alternatively, using adaptation techniques with HMM-based synthesis. Although there are many speaker-dependent voice characteristics, voice conversion deals mainly with those acoustic in nature such as the spectral characteristics and the fundamental frequency. In spite of the remarkable results achieved by the state of the art techniques, further challenges remain to be solved in all sub-areas of voice conversion in order to provide excellent quality and highly successful identity conversion. The objective of this thesis is to develop a stand-alone voice conversion system for coded speech and to propose solutions leading to better quality, versatility or efficiency compared to current techniques. The thesis is focused on the conversion of spectral envelopes but other sub-areas of voice conversion such as speech parameterization or alignment are also treated. The analysis-modification-synthesis system adopted in this thesis is based on a parametric speech model used in a real speech codec but also for the internal speech representation of a concatenative TTS system. This allows an easy integration of voice conversion with communications related and embedded applications developed for coded speech. The validity of this parameterization has been confirmed by using it in an actual voice conversion scheme. In addition, a voicing level control scheme, a speech enhancement technique and a method for automatic speech data collection have been proposed, all of them taking advantage of this parametric framework. The versatility of voice conversion systems depends on the characteristics imposed on the training data in order to properly estimate a conversion function. Depending on the characteristics of the training data different alignment strategies can be adopted. Although dynamic time warping (DTW) has become almost a standard for the alignment of parallel training data, a new soft alignment technique is proposed for the same purpose. This concept allows probabilistic one-to-many frame mapping and is proven valid in an experiment with an artificial example. For practical reasons the non-parallel case has been attracting increased interest lately. In this thesis, two techniques for text independent alignment are proposed. The first one is based on phonetic segmentation and temporal decomposition and was successfully used in a voice conversion application. The second method uses a TTS to break the non-parallel problem into two parallel conversions which concatenated realize the desired voice conversion. GMM-based techniques have been the most popular approach for the conversion of spectral envelopes in spite of their problems related to over-smoothing, over-fitting and the lack of temporal modeling. In order to address these issues and improve the GMM-based voice conversion, this thesis introduces several techniques. First, a new measure of the conversion accuracy is proposed, which can be easily computed from the GMM parameters, and is found to be in line with perceptual and objective metrics. The next technique combines a clustering and mode selection scheme with cluster-wise GMM modeling and is based on the observation that the mapping accuracy improves with the reduction of target data variance. The proposed technique is shown to outperform a comparable approach that uses voicing based clustering. A third technique can be used to adapt an existing well-trained conversion model to a new target speaker using a small amount of data. In a practical evaluation the adapted model outperformed an equivalent model trained exclusively on the reduced data. The continuity issue is addressed in a final idea proposed for future research. In general the spectral conversion techniques proposed in the literature have been subject to a tradeoff between speech quality and identity conversion and the challenge remains to provide optimal results for both criteria simultaneously. A new spectral conversion technique introduced in this thesis uses bilinear models to decompose the line spectral frequencies (LSF) representation of the spectral envelope into two factors corresponding to speaker identity and phonetic content respectively. In an extensive evaluation on different types and for different sizes of training data this approach was found to perform similarly to a GMM-based conversion even though, in contrast to the GMM, it does not require any tuning. The concepts of contextual and local modeling are also introduced arguing that a more accurate mapping can be achieved if multiple models are fit on relatively small subsets of the full training data rather than using one global model. The validity of the concepts has been verified in practical experiments. Furthermore, a local linear transformation technique is shown to effectively reduce the over-smoothing relatively to a globally trained GMM-based conversion function. For spectral conversion, several of the proposed techniques can be considered extensions of a baseline vector quantization framework, opening the way for further developments in this direction. In addition to the local linear transformation method which can be easily integrated in this framework, a memory efficient conversion scheme based on multi-stage vector quantization (MSVQ) was also proposed. The experiments indicated substantial memory savings and even accuracy improvement compared to some conventional codebook conversions. A dynamic programming approach to optimizing the frame to frame continuity in a vector quantization framework is also proposed as a future direction. A final contribution is brought to the existing hybrid technique that combines GMM and frequency warping. The approach is adapted to work with the proposed speech representation and a procedure for automatic formant alignment and warping function calculation is presented.",

We examine the mapping functions of neural networks based on the denoising autoencoder (DAE) model that are conditioned on the mixture magnitude spectra. To approximate the mapping functions, we propose an algorithm inspired by the knowledge distillation, denoted the neural couplings algorithm (NCA). The NCA yields a matrix that expresses the mapping of the mixture to the target source magnitude information. Using the NCA, we examine the mapping functions of three fundamental DAE-based models in music source separation; one with single-layer encoder and decoder, one with multi-layer encoder and single-layer decoder, and one using skip-filtering connections (SF) with a single-layer encoding and decoding. We first train these models with realistic data to estimate the singing voice magnitude spectra from the corresponding mixture. We then use the optimized models and test spectral data as input to the NCA. Our experimental findings show that approaches based on the DAE model learn scalar filtering operators, exhibiting a predominant diagonal structure in their corresponding mapping functions, limiting the exploitation of inter-frequency structure of music data. In contrast, skip-filtering connections are shown to assist the DAE model in learning filtering operators that exploit richer inter-frequency structures.",

Voice activity detection algorithm is an important part of many communication devices, such as mobile phones, because they can be used for example to reduce battery consumption and bandwidth usage. However, the communication devices and also the circumstances in which they are used vary greatly, and thus there does not exist one such voice activity detection algorithm that could be used in every case effectively but the algorithm has to be developed specifically for the problem at hand. In the thesis a voice activity detection algorithm was developed to be used in circumstances, where a very high-level breathing sound is present in the signal. Because the property is unique when compared to previous studies, previously developed voice activity detection algorithms could not be used. Instead, a new voice activity detection algorithm that constitutes of framewise feature extraction, classification of the features and postprocessing was developed. This was done by testing many different options for the parts of the voice activity detection algorithm, evaluating systematically their contribution to the results of the detection and selecting the best combination of parts as the final voice activity detection algorithm. The final voice activity detection algorithm constitutes of Mel-frequency band energies as the features, neural network as the classifier and hidden Markov model as the postprocessing method. All the different options of the algorithm parts and the results obtained with different algorithms were presented in the thesis.",

    abstract = "This thesis proposes signal processing methods for analysis of singing voice audio signals, with the objectives of obtaining information about the identity and lyrics content of the singing. Two main topics are presented, singer identification in monophonic and polyphonic music, and lyrics transcription and alignment. The information automatically extracted from the singing voice is meant to be used for applications such as music classification, sorting and organizing music databases, music information retrieval, etc. For singer identification, the thesis introduces methods from general audio classification and specific methods for dealing with the presence of accompaniment. The emphasis is on singer identification in polyphonic audio, where the singing voice is present along withmusical accompaniment. The presence of instruments is detrimental to voice identification performance, and eliminating the effect of instrumental accompaniment is an important aspect of the problem. The study of singer identification is centered around the degradation of classification performance in presence of instruments, and separation of the vocal line for improving performance. For the study, monophonic singing was mixed with instrumental accompaniment at different signalto- noise (singing-to-accompaniment) ratios and the classification process was performed on the polyphonic mixture and on the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture. The method for classification including the step for separating the vocals is improving significantly the performance compared to classification of the polyphonic mixtures, but not close to the performance in classifying the monophonic singing itself. Nevertheless, the results show that classification of singing voices can be done robustly in polyphonic music when using source separation. In the problem of lyrics transcription, the thesis introduces the general speech recognition framework and various adjustments that can be done before applying themethods on singing voice. The variability of phonation in singing poses a significant challenge to the speech recognition approach. The thesis proposes using phoneme models trained on speech data and adapted to singing voice characteristics for the recognition of phonemes and words from a singing voice signal. Language models and adaptation techniques are an important aspect of the recognition process. There are two different ways of recognizing the phonemes in the audio: one is alignment, when the true transcription is known and the phonemes have to be located, other one is recognition, when both transcription and location of phonemes have to be found. The alignment is, obviously, a simplified form of the recognition task. Alignment of textual lyrics to music audio is performed by aligning the phonetic transcription of the lyrics with the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture, using a collection of commercial songs. The word recognition is tested for transcription of lyrics from monophonic singing. The performance of the proposed system for automatic alignment of lyrics and audio is sufficient for facilitating applications such as automatic karaoke annotation or song browsing. The word recognition accuracy of the lyrics transcription from singing is quite low, but it is shown to be useful in a query-by-singing application, for performing a textual search based on the words recognized from the query. When some key words in the query are recognized, the song can be reliably identified.",

We present the first acoustic self-localization scheme that is passive, and is capable of operating when sensors are moving, and possibly unsynchronized. As a result, the relative microphone positions are obtained and therefore an ad hoc microphone array has been established. The proposed system takes advantage of the knowledge that a device is worn by its user e.g. attached to his/her clothing. A user here acts as a sound source and the sensor is the user-worn microphone. Such an entity is referred to as a node. Node-related spatial information is obtained from Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimated from audio captured by the nodes. Kalman filtering is used for node tracking and prediction of spatial information during periods of node silence. Finally, the node positions are recovered using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The only information required by the proposed system is observations of sounds produced by the nodes such as speech to localize the moving nodes. The general framework for acoustic self-localization is presented followed by an implementation to demonstrate the concept. Real data collected by off-the-shelf equipment is used to evaluate the positioning accuracy of nodes in contrast to image based method. The presented system achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 cm in an acoustic laboratory.",

The intelligibility of modern TTS systems is considered relatively high thus the current emphasis is on developing the naturalness of the synthetic speech. Unit selection speech synthesis utilizes a large pre-recorded speech inventory which provides a sufficient phonetic and prosodic coverage for the language. In synthesis, the best sequence of units, typically half phones or diphones, is retrieved from the inventory and the concatenation of the units is carried out. Unlike in traditional concatenative TTS systems based on prosodic modification, no processing of unit waveforms is required. This increases the quality of the speech by avoiding the modification of units. In this thesis, the full process of constructing a TUT\_VOICE unit selection TTS synthesizer for Finnish is described. The work consisted of the construction of a Finnish voice and the implementation of a synthesis engine. The voice construction included inventory design, recording of a speech inventory with a female voice, phonetic labeling of the speech, and feature extraction. The implementation included building a target unit sequence based on the text to be synthesized, selecting the best sequence of speech units in the inventory, and creation of the output speech waveform by concatenating the selected units. Synthesis quality was in accordance with the expectations: intelligibility was good but quality varied from excellent to poor among different sentences.",

    abstract = "New methods for the design, analysis and generalization of polynomial predictive filters (polynomial predictors for short) are developed in this thesis. Polynomial predictors are a subclass of linear mathematical filters, i.e. linear transformations that transform an input sequence of numbers to an output sequence. Filters are in general used to modify or extract useful information from a signal. Examples of filters are echo cancellers in telephone networks, vocal tract filters in speech synthesizers and analysis filters for EEG signals. Polynomial predictors are useful in situations where the signal of interest changes relatively slowly. Examples of slowly varying signals that can be successfully modeled by polynomials include displacement curves of elevators, the received power level in mobile communication systems and angular accelaration in motor drives. Generally, the filtering of a signal causes delay. However, in many applications, particularly control systems, it is desirable to minimize the delay caused by filtering. Furthermore, the signals in any real-world application contain noise, which we also wish to minimize by filtering. For example, calculating the moving average of a signal generally reduces the noise in the signal, but also causes delay. Polynomial predictors are filters that can predict polynomial signals, and in addition reduce the noise in the signal. In this thesis we determine the precise class of IIR filters which are polynomial predictors, which unifies the various previously proposed predictor structures. Design methods are developed for optimal least-squares FIR polynomial predictors, which enable arbitrary prediction steps, error weighting and an arbitrary desired frequency response. The parameters of predictors based on the general IIR structure are optimized, yielding improvements over the best previously known IIR polynomial predictors. An analysis of the asymptotic properties of polynomial predictors as the filter length grows without bound is carried out, yielding insight into the characteristics of predictors in general, as well as proving a conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of the noise gain. Predictors are generalized for more general signal models than polynomials, and the resulting signal model (corresponding to the solutions of linear homogenous finite difference equations) is shown to be the most general possible. The generalization of the signal model can be interpreted in terms of a z-plane diagram which specifies the complex exponential signals that are predicted. The design methods for FIR polynomial predictors are also carried over to this general signal model. The generalized signal model includes e.g. sinusoidal signals and the design methods are applied to finding improved filters for use in a 50Hz line frequency signal processing application. In addition to the signal model, the filter type is also generalized. This yields design methods for finding the optimal parameters of differentiators, predictive differentiators and integrators, among others. The asymptotic noise gain of generalized predictors is derived and found to depend on the largest modulus of the complex numbers which specify the signal model. Furthermore, an efficient implementation for generalized FIR predictors is derived.",

    abstract = "Loudspeaker is a device that converts electric input signal to acoustic output. The most common type of loudspeaker is a moving-coil transducer. The behaviour of a moving-coil transducer can be considered to be linear only when displacement of the coil-diaphragm assembly is small. When input signal level rises, nonlinearities start to cause audible distortion. In this thesis we examine microspeaker, a small loudspeaker used in mobile phones. The electro-mechanical process which converts the electrical signal into sound waves is exaplained. Based on this, we present a continuous-time, linear model of a loudspeaker mounted in a closed box. The model describes the loudspeaker’s small-signal behaviour using only few parameters. We then consider the main sources of nonlinearities and how to model them. Two major sources nonlinearities are added to the continuous-time model. Then transformations from continuous-time models to discrete-time models are considered. The nonlinear model is converted to discrete-time while taking into account the properties of the microspeaker. The main purpose of this thesis is to study performance of a algorithm that ﬁnds the parameter values of the nonlinear loudspeaker model. Performance of the algorithm is compared to performance of an earlier algorithm for the linear loudspeaker model. The parameter values are found and changes in them are tracked using an adaptive signal processing method called system identiﬁcation. The parameter values are updated using LMS algorithm. Since the discrete-time mechanical model of the microspeaker is based on a recursive ﬁlter, LMS algorithm for recursive ﬁlters is presented. We also review previous research related to parameter identiﬁcation in linear and nonlinear loudspeaker models. Based on results from the experiments the studied algorithm is deemed to be yet incomplete. Linear parameters adapt in general quickly whereas the nonlinear parameters adapt too slowly and sometimes erroneously. The diﬀerence between the output predicted by the nonlinear loudspeaker model and the actual output of the loudspeaker (prediction error) is too high, meaning the parameters do not adapt to their true values. The model is also prone to instability. The algorithm requires further development regarding adaptation speed and prevention of instability. Other development considering initial parameter values and operation during silent moments should also be conducted in the future.",

    abstract = "Automatic guitar chord detection is a process that attempts to detect a guitar chord from a piece of audio. Generally, automatic chord detection is considered to be a part of a large problem termed as automatic transcription. Although there has been a lot of research in the field of automatic transcription, but having a reliable transcription system is still a distant prospect. Chord detection becomes interesting as chords have comparatively stable structure and they completely describe the occurring harmonies in a piece of music. This thesis presents a novel approach for detecting the correctness of musical chords played by guitar. The approach is based on pattern matching technique applied to the database of chords and their typical mistakes. Mistakes are the versions of a chord where typical playing errors are made. Transient of a chord is skipped and its spectrum is whitened. A certain region of whitened spectra is chosen as a feature vector. Cosine distance is computed between the extracted features and the data present in a reference chord database. Finally, the system detects the correctness of a played chord based on k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The developed system uses two types of spectral whitening techniques: one is based on Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and the other is based on Phase Transform-beta (PHAT-beta). The average accuracy shown by LPC based system is 72\% while that of PHAT-beta is 82.5\%. The system was also evaluated under different noise conditions.",

In any normal room, wavefront radiated by the source reaches the microphones after reflecting from the surfaces of the room. On performing the post processing on this recorded signal, depending on the type of source signal used; we obtain the unique signature of the room called the room impulse response (RIR). Historically room impulse responses have been used to calculate the acoustical parameters. These are generally used for objective evaluation of the rooms. Here is an effort to extract more information out of the RIR by understanding the physics of it. In this thesis the reflection from the surfaces is employed as useful information and methods to use this information are presented. The reflective information can be used in the determination of the reflection coefficient of the surface. The reflection coefficients of four common room materials are obtained from their respective impulse response at oblique incidence. The obtained reflection coefficients are studied for the classification of materials. The problem of estimating the room surface using the reflection coefficients has been approached in a systematic way, accounting for parasitic reflections and background noise. The room impulse response is obtained using the sine sweep signal transmitted through the speaker attached to one microphone array, and recorded by another microphone array. The recorded signal was used to identify possible surfaces using clustering on the obtained reflection coefficients. The classification so obtained is compared with the ground truth to calculate the performance and practicability",

    abstract = "Emotion recognition from sound signals represents an emerging field of recent research. Although many existing works focus on emotion recognition from music, there seems to be a relative scarcity of research on emotion recognition from general sounds. One of the key characteristics of sound events is the sound source spatial position, i.e. the location of the source relatively to the acoustic receiver. Existing studies that aim to investigate the relation of the latter source placement and the elicited emotions are limited to distance, front and back spatial localization and/or specific emotional categories. In this paper we analytically investigate the effect of the source angular position on the listener's emotional state, modeled in the well-established valence/arousal affective space. Towards this aim, we have developed an annotated sound events dataset using binaural processed versions of the available International Affective Digitized Sound (IADS) sound events library. All subjective affective annotations were obtained using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) approach. Preliminary results obtained by processing these annotation scores are likely to indicate a systematic change in the listener affective state as the sound source angular position changes. This trend is more obvious when the sound source is located outside of the visible field of the listener.",

    abstract = "Audio information retrieval has been a popular research subject over the last decades and being a subfield of this area, acoustic event classification has a considerable amount of share in the research. In this thesis, acoustic event classification using deep neural networks is investigated. Neural networks have been used in several pattern recognition (both function approximation and classification) tasks. Due to their stacked, layer-wise structure they have been proved to model highly nonlinear relations between inputs and outputs of a system with high performance. Even though several works imply an advantage of deeper networks over shallow ones in terms of recognition performance, advancements in training deep architectures were encountered only recently. These methods excel conventional methods such as HMMs and GMMs in terms of acoustic event classification performance. In this thesis, effects of several NN classifier parameters such as number of hidden layers, number of units in hidden layers, batch size, learning rate etc. on classification accuracy are examined. Effects of implementation parameters such as types of features, number of adjacent frames, number of most energetic frames etc. are also investigated. A classification accuracy of 61.1\% has been achieved with certain parameter values. In the case of DBNs, An application of greedy, layer-wise, unsupervised training before standard supervised training in order to initialize network weights in a better way, provided a 2-4\% improvement in classification performance. A NN that had randomly initialized weights before supervised training was shown to be considerably powerful in terms of acoustic event classification tasks compared to conventional methods. DBNs have provided even better classification accuracies and justified its significant potential for further research on the topic.",

According to musical practice, this requires extraction of notes, their pitches, timings, and classiﬁcation of the instruments used. The respective subproblems, pitch tracking, rhythm detection and the analysis of musical instruments, were studied and are reviewed. Emphasis of this thesis is laid on two points: on literature review and on algorithm development. A literature review was conducted on automatic music transcription and several related areas of interest. An appropriate decomposition of the problem and the selection of an approach is ﬁrst considered. Then the state-of-the-art of the research is represented and discussed, and promising directions for further work are indicated. An original and the most important part of this thesis concerns the development of algorithms that can be used to detect and observe harmonic sounds in polyphonic signals. A novel number theoretical method is proposed, which is motivated by the spectral properties of a mixture of harmonic sounds, especially in musical signals. The performance of the method is evaluated by applying it in a piano music transcription program, which was implemented and simulated in Matlab environment. In the last chapter, the role and use of internal models and predictions in music transcription are discussed. This part of the work introduces processing principles that utilize high-level knowledge sources, such as instrument models and perception-based dependencies in music.",

    abstract = "There are multiple sound events simultaneously occuring in a real-life audio recording collected e.g. at a busy street in rush hour. The events may include traffic noise, sound of rain, people talking etc. The humans are amazingly good at distinguishing these individual events, but as of yet, there is not any machine that can detect these events with (even close to) human accuracy. Polyphonic nature of the environmental audio recordings makes it hard to detect single sound events when many events are overlapping. With the gigantic audio database and state-of-the-art machine learning methods of the digital age, this is bound to change. In this thesis, we use frequency-domain features to represent the audio input and multilabel deep neural networks (DNN) to detect multiple, simultaneous sound events in a real-life recording. We extract frequency-domain features from these recordings in short time frames. DNNs are artificial neural networks (ANN) with two or more hidden layers and they are especially good at modeling highly nonlinear relations and finding intermediate representations between system input and output. This is exactly the case in real-life sound event detection. Every feature extract is used as a training example and we train the neural network with these examples. For the evaluation of this work, we focus on the performance of different topologies of DNNs used in this task. There are a large number of hyper parameters that define the structure of a DNN, such as the number of neurons in a layer, the learning rate used during learning, number of the hidden layers etc. The effects of each of these parameters are investigated in detail. A detection accuracy of 66.5\% is achieved, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin.",

In this paper a feasibility study is presented on a new monitoring concept in which an acoustic pattern classification algorithm running in a wireless sensor is used to automatically assign the measured sound level to different noise sources. A supervised noise source classifier is learned from a small amount of manually annotated recordings and the learned classifier is used to automatically detect the activity of target noise source in the presence of interfering noise sources. The sensor is based on an inexpensive credit-card-sized single-board computer with a microphone and associated electronics and wireless connectivity. The measurement results and the noise source information are transferred from the sensors scattered around the measurement site to a cloud service and a noise portal is used to visualise the measurements to users. The proposed noise monitoring concept was piloted on a rock crushing site. The system ran reliably over 50 days on site, during which it was able to recognise more than 90\% of the noise sources correctly. The pilot study shows that the proposed noise monitoring system can reduce the amount of required human validation of the sound level measurements when the target noise source is clearly defined.",

    abstract = "The application areas of music information retrieval have been gaining popularity over the last decades. Musical instrument recognition is an example of a specific research topic in the field. In this thesis, semi-supervised learning techniques are explored in the context of musical instrument recognition. The conventional approaches employed for musical instrument recognition rely on annotated data, i.e., example recordings of the target instruments with associated information about the target labels in order to perform training. This implies a highly laborious and tedious work of manually annotating the collected training data. The semi-supervised methods enable incorporating additional unannotated data into training. Such data consists of merely the recordings of the instruments and is therefore significantly easier to acquire. Hence, these methods allow keeping the overall development cost at the same level while notably improving the performance of a system. The implemented musical instrument recognition system utilises the mixture model semi-supervised learning scheme in the form of two EM-based algorithms. Furthermore, upgraded versions, namely, the additional labelled data weighting and class-wise retraining, for the improved performance and convergence criteria in terms of the particular classification scenario are proposed. The evaluation is performed on sets consisting of four and ten instruments and yields the overall average recognition accuracy rates of 95.3 and 68.4\%, respectively. These correspond to the absolute gains of 6.1 and 9.7\% compared to the initial, purely supervised cases. Additional experiments are conducted in terms of the effects of the proposed modifications, as well as the investigation of the optimal relative labelled dataset size. In general, the obtained performance improvement is quite noteworthy, and future research directions suggest to subsequently investigate the behaviour of the implemented algorithms along with the proposed and further extended approaches.",

    abstract = "A vast amount of audio features have been proposed in the literature to characterize the content of audio signals. In order to overcome specific problems related to the existing features (such as lack of discriminative power), as well as to reduce the need for manual feature selection, in this article, we propose an evolutionary feature synthesis technique with a built-in feature selection scheme. The proposed synthesis process searches for optimal linear/nonlinear operators and feature weights from a pre-defined multi-dimensional search space to generate a highly discriminative set of new (artificial) features. The evolutionary search process is based on a stochastic optimization approach in which a multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization algorithm, along with fractional global best formation and heterogeneous particle behavior techniques, is applied. Unlike many existing feature generation approaches, the dimensionality of the synthesized feature vector is also searched and optimized within a set range in order to better meet the varying requirements set by many practical applications and classifiers. The new features generated by the proposed synthesis approach are compared with typical low-level audio features in several classification and retrieval tasks. The results demonstrate a clear improvement of up to 15--20\% in average retrieval performance. Moreover, the proposed synthesis technique surpasses the synthesis performance of evolutionary artificial neural networks, exhibiting a considerable capability to accurately distinguish among different audio classes.",

Long-context speech and noise models, where phonetic patterns and noise events may span hundreds of milliseconds, have been found beneficial in such separation tasks. Thus far the majority of work employing non-negative matrix factorisation to long-context spectrogram separation has been conducted on small vocabulary tasks by exploiting large speech and noise dictionaries containing thousands of atoms. In this work we study whether the previously proposed factorisation methods are applicable to more natural speech and limited noise context while keeping the model sizes practically feasible. Results are evaluated on the WSJ0 5k -based 2nd CHiME Challenge Track 2 corpus, where we achieve approximately 4\% absolute improvement in speech recognition rates compared to baseline using the proposed enhancement framework.",

    abstract = "Communication by speech is intrinsic for humans. Since the breakthrough of mobile devices and wireless communication, digital transmission of speech has become ubiquitous. Similarly distribution and storage of audio and video data has increased rapidly. However, despite being technically capable to record and process audio signals, only a fraction of digital systems and services are actually able to work with spoken input, that is, to operate on the lexical content of speech. One persistent obstacle for practical deployment of automatic speech recognition systems is inadequate robustness against noise and other interferences, which regularly corrupt signals recorded in real-world environments. Speech and diverse noises are both complex signals, which are not trivially separable. Despite decades of research and a multitude of different approaches, the problem has not been solved to a sufficient extent. Especially the mathematically ill-posed problem of separating multiple sources from a single-channel input requires advanced models and algorithms to be solvable. One promising path is using a composite model of long-context atoms to represent a mixture of non-stationary sources based on their spectro-temporal behaviour. Algorithms derived from the family of non-negative matrix factorisations have been applied to such problems to separate and recognise individual sources like speech. This thesis describes a set of tools developed for non-negative modelling of audio spectrograms, especially involving speech and real-world noise sources. An overview is provided to the complete framework starting from model and feature definitions, advancing to factorisation algorithms, and finally describing different routes for separation, enhancement, and recognition tasks. Current issues and their potential solutions are discussed both theoretically and from a practical point of view. The included publications describe factorisation-based recognition systems, which have been evaluated on publicly available speech corpora in order to determine the efficiency of various separation and recognition algorithms. Several variants and system combinations that have been proposed in literature are also discussed. The work covers a broad span of factorisation-based system components, which together aim at providing a practically viable solution to robust processing and recognition of speech in everyday situations.",

    abstract = "This thesis consists in the extension of the baseline system for Acoustic Scene Classification, developed by the Audio Research Group at Tampere university of Technology for the challenge of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE). The baseline is based on a supervised classification approach which is composed by training and testing stages. The training stage is based on the construction of a statistical model capable to describe each of the environmental classes that will be used during the training stage. The innovation part has the goal of clustering the available observations so that each class is divided into some subclasses. The models will be created for each subclass. These models describe acoustic environments in more detail, which allows achieving higher level of accuracy. The system has preserved its previous stages and the method used for the clustering has been k-means. The experiments have been performed firstly with the development dataset and the results obtained have been validated with the challenge dataset aiming to verify that the system is capable to generalize its results. Three different approaches have been tested: First, the number of clusters has been set invariant for all the classes. Values 2, 3, 5 and 10 have been tested. The performance has increased 2\% for 2 clusters. Second, the number of clusters has been selected manually choosing the values that proved to provide better performance for each class during the development stage. The performance has increased 2.3\% with respect to the baseline. Third approach is more sophisticated and includes cluster evaluation based on BD and CH indices. This method allows calculating the number of clusters for each class automatically. It has improved the performance in 2\% with respect to the baseline.",

Our main target is to create a system, which has several co-operating management tools for audio database and which improve the results of each other. Bayesian networks based audio classification algorithm provides classification into four main audio classes (silence, speech, music, and noise) and serves as a first step for other subsequent analysis tools. For speech analysis we propose an improved Bayesian information criterion based speaker segmen-tation and clustering algorithm applying also a combined gender and emotion detection algorithm utilizing prosodic features. For the other main classes it is often hard to device any general and well functional pre-categorization that would fit the unforesee-able types of user recorded data. For compensating the absence of analysis tools for these classes we propose the use of efficient audio similarity measure and query-by-example algorithm with database clustering capabilities. The experimental results show that the combined use of the algorithms is feasible in practice.",

    abstract = "Crying is the first means of communication for an infant through which it expresses its physiological and psychological needs. Infant cry analysis is the investigation of infant cry vocalizations in order to extract social and communicative information about infant behavior, and diagnostic information about infant health. This thesis is part of a larger study whose objective is to analyze the acoustic properties of infant cry signals and use it for early assessment of neurological developmental issues in infants. This thesis deals with two research problems in the context of infant cry signals: audio segmentation of cry recordings in order to extract relevant acoustic parts, and fundamental frequency (F0) estimation of the extracted acoustic regions. The extracted acoustic regions are relevant for extracting parameters useful for drawing correlation with developmental outcomes of the infants. Fundamental frequency (F0) is one such potentially useful parameter whose variation has been found to correlate with cases of neurological insults in infants. The cry recordings are captured in realistic hospital environments under varied contexts like infant crying out of hunger, pain etc. A hidden Markov model (HMM) based audio segmentation system is proposed. The performance of the system is evaluated for different configurations of HMM states, number of component Gaussians, and using different combinations of audio features. Frame based accuracy of 88.5 \% is achieved. YIN algorithm, a popular F0 estimation algorithm, is utilized to deal with the fundamental frequency estimation problem, and a method to discard unreliable F0 estimates is suggested. The statistics associated with distribution of F0 estimates corresponding to different components of cry signals are reported. This work would be followed up to find meaningful correlations between extracted F0 estimates and developmental outcomes of the infants. Moreover, other acoustic parameters would also be investigated for the same purpose.",

    abstract = "Emotions in speech are a fundamental part of a natural dialog. In everyday life, vocal interaction with people often implies emotions as an intrinsic part of the conversation to a greater or lesser extent. Thus, the inclusion of emotions in human-machine dialog systems is crucial to achieve an acceptable degree of naturalness in the communication. This thesis focuses on automatic emotion conversion of speech, a technique whose aim is to transform an utterance produced in neutral style to a certain emotion state in a speaker independent context. Conversion of emotions represents a challenge in the sense that emotions a affect significantly all the parts of the human vocal production system, and in the conversion process all these factors must be taken into account carefully. The techniques used in the literature are based on voice conversion approaches, with minor modifications to create the sensation of emotion. In this thesis, the idea of voice conversion systems is used as well, but the usual regression process is divided in a two-step procedure that provides additional speaker normalization to remove the intrinsic speaker dependency of this kind of systems, using vocal tract length normalization as a pre-processing technique. In addition, a new method to convert the duration trend of the utterance and the intonation contour is proposed, taking into account the contextual information.",

    abstract = "The objective of this thesis is to investigate how a deep learning model called recurrent neural network (RNN) performs in the task of detecting overlapping sound events in real life environments. Examples of such sound events include dog barking, footsteps, and crowd applauding. When several sound sources are active simultaneously, as it is often the case in everyday contexts, identifying individual sound events from their polyphonic mixture is a challenging task. Other factors such as noise and distortions contribute to making even more difficult to explicitly implement a computer program to solve the detection task. We present an approach to polyphonic sound event detection in real life recordings based on a RNN architecture called bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM). A multilabel BLSTM RNN is trained to map the time-frequency representation of a mixture signal consisting of sounds from multiple sources, to binary activity indicators of each event class. Our method is tested on two large databases of recordings, both containing sound events from more than 60 different classes, and in one case from 10 different everyday contexts. Furthermore, in order to reduce overfitting we propose to use several data augmentation techniques: time stretching, sub-frame time shifting, and block mixing. The proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, despite using half of the parameters, and the results are further largely improved using the block mixing data augmentation technique. Overall, for the first dataset our approach reports an average F1-score of 65.5\% on 1 second blocks and 64.7\% on single frames, a relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art approach of 6.8\% and 15.1\% respectively. For the second dataset our system reports an average F1- score of 84.4\% on 1 second blocks and 85.1\% on single frames, a relative improvement over the baseline approach of 38.4\% and 35.9\% respectively.",

In a similar way, we have the ability to recognize di erent speakers, despite the linguistic content of the speech. Additionally to the voice individuality of the speaker, the particular prosody of speech involves relevant information concerning the identity, age, social group or economical status of the speaker, helping us identify the person to whom we are talking without seeing the speaker. Voice conversion systems deal with the conversion of a speech signal to sound as if it was uttered by another speaker. It has been an important amount of work in the conversion of the timber of the voice, the spectral features, meanwhile the conversion of pitch and the way it temporarily evolves, modeling the speaker dependent prosody, is mostly achieved by just controlling the level and range. This thesis focuses on prosody conversion, proposing an approach based on a wavelet transformation of the pitch contours. It has been performed a study of the wavelet domain, discerning among the di erent timing of the prosodic events, thus allowing an improved modeling of them. Consequently, the prosody conversion is achieved in the wavelet domain, using regression techniques originally developed for the spectral features conversion, in voice conversion systems.",

However, sometimes databases contain certain inherent voice qualities that need to be parametrized properly. One example of this is vocal fry typically occurring at the end of utterances. A popular mixed excitation vocoder for HMMbased speech synthesis is STRAIGHT. The standard STRAIGHT is optimized for modal voices and may not produce high quality with other voice types. Fortunately, due to the flexibility of STRAIGHT, different F0 and aperiodicity measures can be used in the synthesis without any inherent degradations in speech quality. We have replaced the STRAIGHT excitation with a representation based on a robust F0 measure and a carefully determined two-band voicing. According to our analysis-synthesis experiments, the new parameterization can improve the speech quality. In HMM-based speech synthesis, the quality is significantly improved especially due to the better modeling of vocal fry.",

    abstract = "Given an audio query, such as polyphonic musical piece, this thesis address the problem of retrieving a matching (similar) musical score data from a collection of musical scores. There are different techniques for measuring similarity between any musical piece such as metadata based similarity measure, collaborative filtering and content-based similarity measure. In this thesis, we use the information in the digital music itself for similarity measures and this technique is known as content-based similarity measure. First we extract chroma features to represents musical segments. Chroma feature captures both melodic information and harmonic information and is robust to timbre variation. Tempo variation in the performance of a same song may cause dissimilarity between them. In order to address this issue we extract beat sequences and combine them with chroma features to obtain beat synchronous chroma features. Next, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. This algorithm first computes the DTW matrix between two feature sequences and calculates the cost of traversing from starting point to end point of the matrix. Minimum the cost value, more similar the musical segments are. The performance of DTW is improved by choosing suitable path constraints and path weight. Then, we implement LSH algorithm, which first indexes the data and then searches for a similar item. Processing time of LSH is shorter than that of DTW. For a smaller fragment of query audio, say 30 seconds, LSH outperformed DTW. Performance of LSH depends on the number of hash tables, number of projections per table and width of the projection. Both algorithms were applied in two types of data sets, RWC (where audio and midi are from the same source) and TUT (where audio and midi are from different sources). The contribution of this thesis is twofold. First we proposed a suitable feature representation of a musical segment for melodic similarity. And then we apply two different similarity measure algorithms and enhance their performances. This thesis work also includes development of mobile application capable of recording audio from surroundings and displaying its acoustic features in real time.",

This task concerns the recognition of an acoustic scene, like a park or a home, performed by an artiﬁcial system. In our work we examine the use of deep models aiming to give a contribution in one of their use cases which is, in our opinion, one of the most poorly explored. The neural architecture we propose in this work is a convolutional neural network speciﬁcally designed to work on a time-frequency audio representation known as log-mel spectrogram. The network output is an array of prediction scores, each of which is associated with one class of a set of 15 predeﬁned classes. In addition, the architecture features batch normalization, a recently proposed regularization technique used to enhance the network performance and to speed up its training. We also investigate the use of different audio sequence lengths as classiﬁcation unit for our network. Thanks to these experiments we observe that, for our artiﬁcial system, the recognition of long sequences is not easier than of medium-length sequences, hence highlighting a counterintuitive behaviour. Moreover, we introduce a training procedure which aims to make the best of small datasets by using all the labeled data available for the network training. This procedure, possible under particular circumstances, constitutes a trade-off between an accurate training stop and an increased data representation available to the network. Finally, we compare our model to other systems, proving that its recognition ability can outperform either other neural architectures as well as other state-of-the-art statistical classiﬁers, like support vector machines and Gaussian mixture models. The proposed system reaches good accuracy scores on two different databases collected in 2013 and 2016. The best accuracy scores, obtained according to two cross-validation setups, are 77\% and 79\% respectively. These scores constitute a 22\% and 6.1\% accuracy increment with respect to the correspondent baselines published together with datasets.",

Particularly, music recommendation is a highlighted topic because of its commercial value coming from the large music industry. Popular online music recommendation services, including Spotify, Pandora and Last.FM use similarity-based approaches to generate recommendations. In this thesis work, I propose a personalized music recommendation approach that is based on probability estimation without any similarity calculation involved. In my system, each user gets a score for every piece of music. The score is obtained by combining two estimated probabilities of an acceptance. One estimated probability is based on the user’s preferences on timbres. Another estimated probability is the empirical acceptance rate of a music piece. The weighted arithmetic mean is evaluated to be the best performing combination function. An online demonstration of my system is available at www.shuyang.eu/plg/. Demonstrating recommendation results show that the system works effectively. Through the algorithm analysis on my system, we can see that my system has good reactivity and scalability without suffering cold start problem. The accuracy of my recommendation approach is evaluated with Million Song Dataset. My system achieves a pairwise ranking accuracy of 0.592, which outperforms random ranking (0.5) and ranking by popularity (0.557). Unfortunately, I have not found any other music recommendation method evaluated with ranking accuracy yet.

While traditional approaches do not exploit phase constraints that originate from signal modeling, some prior information about the phase can be obtained from sinusoidal modeling. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic mixture model which allows us to incorporate such phase priors within a source separation framework. While the magnitudes are estimated beforehand, the phases are modeled by Von Mises random variables whose location parameters are the phase priors. We then approximate this non-tractable model by an anisotropic Gaussian model, in which the phase dependencies are preserved. This enables us to derive an MMSE estimator of the sources which optimally combines Wiener filtering and prior phase estimates. Experimental results highlight the potential of incorporating phase priors into mixture models for separating overlapping components in complex audio mixtures.",

As shown also in this thesis, the stochastic optimization techniques and models have become an important and notable paradigm in a wide range of application areas, including transportation models, financial instruments, and network design. Stochastic optimization is especially developed for solving the problems that are either too difficult or impossible to solve analytically by deterministic optimization approaches. In this thesis, the focus is put on applying several stochastic optimization algorithms to two audio-specific application areas, namely sniper positioning and content-based audio classification and retrieval. In short, the first application belongs to an area of spatial audio, whereas the latter is a topic of machine learning and, more specifically, multimedia information retrieval. The SO algorithms considered in the thesis are particle filtering (PF), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA), which are extended, combined and applied to the specified problems in a novel manner. Based on their iterative and evolving nature, especially the PSO algorithms are often included to the category of evolutionary algorithms. Considering the sniper positioning application, in this thesis the PF and SA algorithms are employed to optimize the parameters of a mathematical shock wave model based on observed firing event wavefronts. Such an inverse problem is suitable for Bayesian approach, which is the main motivation for including the PF approach among the considered optimization methods. It is shown – also with SA – that by applying the stated shock wave model, the proposed stochastic parameter estimation approach provides statistically reliable and qualified results. The content-based audio classification part of the thesis is based on a dedicated framework consisting of several individual binary classifiers. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used within the framework, for which the parameters and network structures are optimized based the desired item outputs, i.e. the ground truth class labels. The optimization process is carried out using a multi-dimensional extension of the regular PSO algorithm (MD PSO). The audio retrieval experiments are performed in the context of feature generation (synthesis), which is an approach for generating new audio features/attributes based on some conventional features originally extracted from a particular audio database. Here the MD PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the feature generation process, wherein the dimensionality of the generated feature vector is also optimized. Both from practical perspective and the viewpoint of complexity theory, stochastic optimization techniques are often computationally demanding. Because of this, the practical implementations discussed in this thesis are designed as directly applicable to parallel computing. This is an important and topical issue considering the continuous increase of computing grids and cloud services. Indeed, many of the results achieved in this thesis are computed using a grid of several computers. Furthermore, since also personal computers and mobile handsets include an increasing number of processor cores, such parallel implementations are not limited to grid servers only.",

    abstract = "Speaker identity plays an important role in human communication. In addition to the linguistic content, speech utterances contain acoustic information of the speaker characteristics. This thesis focuses on voice conversion, a technique that aims at changing the voice of one speaker (a source speaker) into the voice of another specific speaker (a target speaker) without changing the linguistic information. The relationship between the source and target speaker characteristics is learned from the training data. Voice conversion can be used in various applications and fields: text-to-speech systems, dubbing, speech-to-speech translation, games, voice restoration, voice pathology, etc. Voice conversion offers many challenges: which features to extract from speech, how to find linguistic correspondences (alignment) between source and target features, which machine learning techniques to use for creating a mapping function between the features of the speakers, and finally, how to make the desired modifications to the speech waveform. The features can be any parameters that describe the speech and the speaker identity, e.g. spectral envelope, excitation, fundamental frequency, and phone durations. The main focus of the thesis is on the design of suitable mapping techniques between frame-level source and target features, but also aspects related to parallel data alignment and prosody conversion are addressed. The perception of the quality and the success of the identity conversion are largely subjective. Conventional statistical techniques are able to produce good similarity between the original and the converted target voices but the quality is usually degraded. The objective of this thesis is to design conversion techniques that enable successful identity conversion while maintaining the original speech quality. Due to the limited amount of data, statistical techniques are usually utilized in extracting the mapping function. The most popular technique is based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). However, conventional GMM-based conversion suffers from many problems that result in degraded speech quality. The problems are analyzed in this thesis, and a technique that combines GMM-based conversion with partial least squares regression is introduced to alleviate these problems. Additionally, approaches to solve the time-independent mapping problem associated with many algorithms are proposed. The most significant contribution of the thesis is the proposed novel dynamic kernel partial least squares regression technique that allows creating a non-linear mapping function and improves temporal correlation. The technique is straightforward, efficient and requires very little tuning. It is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art GMM-based technique using both subjective and objective tests over a variety of speaker pairs. In addition, quality is further improved when aperiodicity and binary voicing values are predicted using the same technique. The vast majority of the existing voice conversion algorithms concern the transformation of the spectral envelopes. However, prosodic features, such as fundamental frequency movements and speaking rhythm, also contain important cues of identity. It is shown in the thesis that pure prosody alone can be used, to some extent, to recognize speakers that are familiar to the listeners. Furthermore, a prosody conversion technique is proposed that transforms fundamental frequency contours and durations at syllable level. The technique is shown to improve similarity to the target speaker’s prosody and reduce roboticness compared to a conventional frame-based conversion technique. Recently, the trend has shifted from text-dependent to text-independent use cases meaning that there is no parallel data available. The techniques proposed in the thesis currently assume parallel data, i.e. that the same texts have been spoken by both speakers. However, excluding the prosody conversion algorithm, the proposed techniques require no phonetic information and are applicable for a small amount of training data. Moreover, many text-independent approaches are based on extracting a sort of alignment as a pre-processing step. Thus the techniques proposed in the thesis can be exploited after the alignment process.",

    abstract = "Sensors are used for obtaining information from their operating environment. Recently, the use of multiple sensory units as arrays or networks has become popular. This has been caused by developments in sensor technology and the inherent application potential. Costs of sensory units and systems have decreased with developments in electronics. In addition, advances in communication technologies, such as wireless operation, make it easier to deploy systems with a large number of sensory units. Several applications exist for these systems in the areas of monitoring, control, surveillance, communications and multimedia devices. With developments, come additional requirements. Sensor systems are expected to operate for long periods of time, possibly unattended. Furthermore, environmental and signal conditions may be adverse. As a result, errors caused by disturbances occur in system output and hardware malfunctions may develop between scheduled maintenance. Automatic operation is still expected and even if human operators are available, manual inspection of the data from individual units is not feasible in large systems. This raises the need for error-tolerant processing, that is able to assess the quality of produced data and detect potential malfunctions. This thesis addresses these issues within acoustic direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. An array of microphones is utilized to acquire acoustic pressure signals from a far-field source. Time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between the sensors are estimated and used to compute the direction estimate. Specifically, the plane wave slowness vector (SV) formulation of the problem is examined, allowing a linear model to be used for estimation. In practice, signals are noisy and time delay estimates contain large errors making the directional estimates inaccurate. This work examines confidence scores that can be used to evaluate the instantaneous estimation error and to remove highly erroneous delay estimates from the processing. A robust and scalable DOA estimator is introduced. It is further demonstrated with experiments that confidence scores can be used for signal activity detection, outlier removal and sensor failure compensation. One of the examined confidence scores is based on closed-path properties of TDOAs. This score is generalized beyond the plane wave DOA domain to a difference quantity model. Examples of difference quantities include voltages and spherical-wave TDOAs used in source localization. The scoring principle is brought into a statistical framework and outlier detection is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. An optimum detector is derived and its properties are analyzed. The results of this work provide simple and computationally light means for sensor arrays to diagnose their operation instantaneously in dynamic conditions.",

    abstract = "The objective of this thesis is to develop novel classiﬁcation and feature learning techniques for the task of sound event detection (SED) in real-world environments. Throughout their lives, humans experience a consistent learning process on how to assign meanings to sounds. Thanks to this, most of the humans can easily recognize the sound of a thunder, dog bark, door bell, bird singing etc. In this work, we aim to develop systems that can automatically detect the sound events commonly present in our daily lives. Such systems can be utilized in e.g. contextaware devices, acoustic surveillance, bio-acoustical and healthcare monitoring, and smart-home cities. In this thesis, we propose to apply the modern machine learning methods called deep learning for SED. The relationship between the commonly used timefrequency representations for SED (such as mel spectrogram and magnitude spectrogram) and the target sound event labels are highly complex. Deep learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNN) utilize a layered structure of units to extract features from the given sound representation input with increased abstraction at each layer. This increases the network’s capacity to eﬃciently learn the highly complex relationship between the sound representation and the target sound event labels. We found that the proposed DNN approach performs signiﬁcantly better than the established classiﬁer techniques for SED such as Gaussian mixture models. In a time-frequency representation of an audio recording, a sound event can often be recognized as a distinct pattern that may exhibit shifts in both dimensions. The intra-class variability of the sound events may cause to small shifts in the frequency domain content, and the time domain shift results from the fact that a sound event can occur at any time for a given audio recording. We found that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are useful to learn shift-invariant ﬁlters that are essential for robust modeling of sound events. In addition, we show that recurrent neural networks (RNN) are eﬀective in modeling the long-term temporal characteristics of the sound events. Finally, we combine the convolutional and recurrent layers in a single classiﬁer called convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN), which emphasizes the beneﬁts of both and provides state-of-the-art results in multiple SED benchmark datasets. Aside from learning the mappings between the time-frequency representations and the sound event labels, we show that deep learning methods can also be utilized to learn a direct mapping between the the target labels and a lower level representation such as the magnitude spectrogram or even the raw audio signals. In this thesis, the feature learning capabilities of the deep learning methods and the empirical knowledge on the human auditory perception are proposed to be integrated through the means of layer weight initialization with ﬁlterbank coeﬃcients. This results with an optimal, ad-hoc ﬁlterbank that is obtained through gradient based optimization of the original coeﬃcients to improve the SED performance.",

In this paper, we introduce the Positive α-stable (PαS) distributions to model the latent sources, which are a subclass of the stable distributions family. They notably permit us to model random variables that are both nonnegative and impulsive. Considering the Levy distribution, the only PαS distribution whose density is tractable, we propose a mixture model called L{\'e}vy Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (L{\'e}vy NMF). This model accounts for low-rank structures in nonnegative data that possibly has high variability or is corrupted by very adverse noise. The model parameters are estimated in a maximum-likelihood sense. We also derive an estimator of the sources, which extends the validity of the Wiener filtering to the PαS case. Experiments on synthetic data and realistic music signals show that L{\'e}vy NMF compares favorably with state-of-the art techniques in terms of robustness to impulsive noise and highlight its potential for decomposing nonnegative data.",

The approach specifically addresses the challenging case of separation where no training data are available. By representing mixtures in the modulation spectrogram (MS) domain, we exploit underlying similarities in patterns present across frequency. A three-dimensional tensor factorization is able to take advantage of these redundant patterns, and is used to separate a mixture into an approximated sum of components by minimizing a divergence cost. Furthermore, we show that the basic tensor factorization can be extended with convolution in time being used to improve separation results and provide update rules to learn components in such a manner. Following factorization, sources are reconstructed in the audio domain from estimated components using a novel approach based on reconstruction masks that are learned using MS activations, and then applied to a mixture spectrogram. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior separation performance to a spectrally based nonnegative matrix factorization approach, in terms of source-to-distortion ratio. We also compare separation with the perceptually motivated interference-related perceptual score metric and identify cases with higher performance.",

The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values, reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in comparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of overlapping sound events.",

    abstract = "During the past decades, many areas of speech processing have benefited from the vast increases in the available memory sizes and processing power. For example, speech recognizers can be trained with enormous speech databases and high-quality speech synthesizers can generate new speech sentences by concatenating speech units retrieved from a large inventory of speech data. However, even in today's world of ever-increasing memory sizes and computational resources, there are still lots of embedded application scenarios for speech processing techniques where the memory capacities and the processor speeds are very limited. Thus, there is still a clear demand for solutions that can operate with limited resources, e.g., on low-end mobile devices. This thesis introduces a new segmental parametric speech codec referred to as the VLBR codec. The novel proprietary sinusoidal speech codec designed for efficient speech storage is capable of achieving relatively good speech quality at compression ratios beyond the ones offered by the standardized speech coding solutions, i.e., at bitrates of approximately 1 kbps and below. The efficiency of the proposed coding approach is based on model simplifications, mode-based segmental processing, and the method of adaptive downsampling and quantization. The coding efficiency is also further improved using a novel flexible multi-mode matrix quantizer structure and enhanced dynamic codebook reordering. The compression is also facilitated using a new perceptual irrelevancy removal method. The VLBR codec is also applied to text-to-speech synthesis. In particular, the codec is utilized for the compression of unit selection databases and for the parametric concatenation of speech units. It is also shown that the efficiency of the database compression can be further enhanced using speaker-specific retraining of the codec. Moreover, the computational load is significantly decreased using a new compression-motivated scheme for very fast and memory-efficient calculation of concatenation costs, based on techniques and implementations used in the VLBR codec. Finally, the VLBR codec and the related speech synthesis techniques are complemented with voice conversion methods that allow modifying the perceived speaker identity which in turn enables, e.g., cost-efficient creation of new text-to-speech voices. The VLBR-based voice conversion system combines compression with the popular Gaussian mixture model based conversion approach. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed for converting the prosodic aspects of speech. The performance of the VLBR-based voice conversion system is also enhanced using a new approach for mode selection and through explicit control of the degree of voicing. The solutions proposed in the thesis together form a complete system that can be utilized in different ways and configurations. The VLBR codec itself can be utilized, e.g., for efficient compression of audio books, and the speech synthesis related methods can be used for reducing the footprint and the computational load of concatenative text-to-speech synthesizers to levels required in some embedded applications. The VLBR-based voice conversion techniques can be used to complement the codec both in storage applications and in connection with speech synthesis. It is also possible to only utilize the voice conversion functionality, e.g., in games or other entertainment applications.",

    abstract = "The increasing use of mobile technology in everyday life has aroused interest into developing new ways of utilizing the data collected by devices such as mobile phones and wearable devices. Acoustic sensors can be used to localize sound sources if the positions of spatially separate sensors are known or can be determined. However, the process of determining the 3D coordinates by manual measurements is tedious especially with increasing number of sensors. Therefore, the localization process has to be automated. Satellite based positioning is imprecise for many applications and requires line-of-sight to the sky. This thesis studies localization methods for wireless acoustic sensor networks and the process is called self-localization.This thesis focuses on self-localization from sound, and therefore the term acoustic is used. Furthermore, the development of the methods aims at utilizing ad hoc sensor networks, which means that the sensors are not necessarily installed in the premises like meeting rooms and other purpose-built spaces, which often have dedicated audio hardware for spatial audio applications. Instead of relying on such spaces and equipment, mobile devices are used, which are combined to form sensor networks.For instance, a few mobile phones laid on a table can be used to create a sensor network built for an event and it is inherently dismantled once the event is over, which explains the use of the term ad hoc. Once positions of the devices are estimated, the network can be used for spatial applications such as sound source localization and audio enhancement via spatial ﬁltering. The main purpose of this thesis is to present the methods for self-localization of such an ad hoc acoustic sensor network. Using off-the-shelf ad hoc devices to establish sensor networks enables implementation of many spatial algorithms basically in any environment.Several acoustic self-localization methods have been introduced over the years. However, they often rely on specialized hardware and calibration signals. This thesis presents methods that are passive and utilize environmental sounds such as speech from which, by using time delay estimation, the spatial information of the sensor network can be determined. Many previous self-localization methods assume that audio captured by the sensors is synchronized. This assumption cannot be made in an ad hoc sensor network, since the different sensors are unaware of each other without speciﬁc signaling that is not available without special arrangement.The methods developed in this thesis are evaluated with simulations and real data recordings. Scenarios in which the targets of positioning are stationary and in motion are studied. The real world recordings are made in closed spaces such as meeting rooms. The targets are approximately 1 – 5 meters apart. The positioning accuracy is approximately ﬁve centimeters in a stationary scenario, and ten centimeters in a moving-target scenario on average. The most important result of this thesis is presenting the ﬁrst self-localization method that uses environmental sounds and off-the-shelf unsynchronized devices, and allows the targets of self-localization to move.",

The objective of the task is to detect acoustic events (door slam, steps, paper wrapping etc.) using acoustic data from a multiple microphone set up in the meeting room environment. A system based on hidden Markov models and multi-channel audio data was implemented. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are used to represent the power spectrum of the acoustic signal. Fully-connected three-state hidden Markov models are trained for 12 acoustic events and one-state models are trained for speech, silence, and unknown events.",

    abstract = "When developing advanced location-based systems augmented with audio ambiances, it would be cost-effective to use a few representative samples from typical environments for describing a larger number of similar locations. The aim of this experiment was to study the human ability to discriminate audio ambiances recorded in similar locations of the same urban environment. A listening experiment consisting of material from three different environments and nine different locations was carried out with nineteen subjects to study the credibility of audio representations for certain environments which would diminish the need for collecting huge audio databases. The first goal was to study to what degree humans are able to recognize whether the recording has been made in an indicated location or in another similar location, when presented with the name of the place, location on a map, and the associated audio ambiance. The second goal was to study whether the ability to discriminate audio ambiances from different locations is affected by a visual cue, by presenting additional information in form of a photograph of the suggested location. The results indicate that audio ambiances from similar urban areas of the same city differ enough so that it is not acceptable to use a single recording as ambience to represent different yet similar locations. Including an image was found to increase the perceived credibility of all the audio samples in representing a certain location. The results suggest that developers of audio-augmented location-based systems should aim at using audio samples recorded on-site for each location in order to achieve a credible impression.",

    abstract = "We introduce an adaptive algorithm for constraining the amplitude of speech signals while at the same time trying to maintain the subjective loudness and trying not to produce disturbing artifacts. The algorithm can be applied to compensate for the clipping distortion of amplifiers in speech reproduction devices. The algorithm analyzes the speech signal on multiple frequency bands and applies an internal audibility law in order to make inaudible changes to the signal. An example of the audibility law, presented in the form of a matrix, is described, associated with a specific speech reproduction device. Multiple band-pass signals are processed with a waveshaper to accomplish soft-clipping and to constrain the amplitude of the processed signal. When processed with the proposed algorithm, the computational loudness value of speech signals was found to diminish only slightly (approximately 6 sones) during processing, while at the same time the signal amplitude could be reduced by even 15 dB.",

In hidden Markov model-based text-to-speech (HMM-TTS), durations are typically modeled statistically using state duration probability distributions and duration prediction for unseen contexts. Use of rich context features enables synthesis without high-level linguistic knowledge. In this paper we analyze the accuracy of state duration modeling against phone duration modeling using simple prediction techniques. In addition to the decision tree-based techniques, regression techniques for rich context features with high collinearity are discussed and evaluated.",

    abstract = "In hidden Markov model-based speech synthesis, speech is typically parameterized using source-filter decomposition. A widely used analysis/synthesis framework, STRAIGHT, decomposes the speech waveform into a framewise spectral envelope and a mixed mode excitation signal. Inclusion of an aperiodicity measure in the model enables synthesis also for signals that are not purely voiced or unvoiced. In the traditional approach employing hidden Markov modeling and decision tree-based clustering, the connection between speech spectrum and aperiodicities is not taken into account. In this paper, we take advantage of this dependency and predict voice aperiodicities afterwards based on synthetic spectral representations. The evaluations carried out for English data confirm that the proposed approach is able to provide prediction accuracy that is comparable to the traditional approach.",

The differences in the arrival times of the wideband signal received by spatially separated sensors are estimated using the polarity coincidence correlation. These time differences, i.e. time delays, determine the angle of arrival. In this paper the effects of quantization of the time delays are studied. It is found out that this simple method gives comparable performance to the conventional direct correlation based methods in the case of a relatively high signal to noise ratio.",
