Even though the analysis tasks in many applications seem different, the underlying computational methods are typically based on the same principles. We explain the commonalities between analysis tasks such as sound event detection, sound scene classification, or audio tagging. We focus on the machine learning approach, where the sound categories (i.e., classes) to be analyzed are defined in advance. We explain the typical components of an analysis system, including signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and pattern classification. We also preset an example system based on multi-label deep neural networks, which has been found to be applicable in many analysis tasks discussed in this book. Finally, we explain the whole processing chain that involves developing computational audio analysis systems.",

Recently, computational music content analysis has received considerable attention among researchers due to the rapid growth of music databases. In this area of research, melody transcription plays an important role. Automatic melody transcription can beneﬁt professional musicians and provide interesting applications for consumers, including music retrieval and interactive music applications. The proposed method is based on two probabilistic models: a note event model and a musicological model. The note event model is used to represent note candidates in melodies, and it is based on hidden Markov models. The note event model is trained with an acoustic database of singing sequences, but the training can be done for any melodic instrument and for the desired front-end feature extractors. The musicological model is used to control the transitions between the note candidates by using musical key estimation and by computing the likelihoods of note sequences. The two models are combined to constitute a melody transcription system with a modular architecture. The transcription system is evaluated, and the results are good. Our system transcribes correctly over 90 \% of notes, thus halving the amount of errors compared to a simple rounding of pitch estimates to the nearest MIDI note numbers. Particularly, using the note event model signiﬁcantly improves the system performance.",

    abstract = "Transcription of music refers to the analysis of a music signal in order to produce a parametric representation of the sounding notes in the signal. This is conventionally carried out by listening to a piece of music and writing down the symbols of common musical notation to represent the occurring notes in the piece. Automatic transcription of music refers to the extraction of such representations using signal-processing methods. This thesis concerns the automatic transcription of pitched notes in musical audio and its applications. Emphasis is laid on the transcription of realistic polyphonic music, where multiple pitched and percussive instruments are sounding simultaneously. The methods included in this thesis are based on a framework which combines both low-level acoustic modeling and high-level musicological modeling. The emphasis in the acoustic modeling has been set to note events so that the methods produce discrete-pitch notes with onset times and durations as output. Such transcriptions can be efficiently represented as MIDI files, for example, and the transcriptions can be converted to common musical notation via temporal quantization of the note onsets and durations. The musicological model utilizes musical context and trained models of typical note sequences in the transcription process. Based on the framework, this thesis presents methods for generic polyphonic transcription, melody transcription, and bass line transcription. A method for chord transcription is also presented. All the proposed methods have been extensively evaluated using realistic polyphonic music. In our evaluations with 91 half-a-minute music excerpts, the generic polyphonic transcription method correctly found 39\% of all the pitched notes (recall) where 41\% of the transcribed notes were correct (precision). Despite the seemingly low recognition rates in our simulations, this method was top-ranked in the polyphonic note tracking task in the international MIREX evaluation in 2007 and 2008. The methods for the melody, bass line, and chord transcription were evaluated using hours of music, where F-measure of 51\% was achieved for both melodies and bass lines. The chord transcription method was evaluated using the first eight albums by The Beatles and it produced correct frame-based labeling for about 70\% of the time. The transcriptions are not only useful as human-readable musical notation but in several other application areas too, including music information retrieval and content-based audio modification. This is demonstrated by two applications included in this thesis. The first application is a query by humming system which is capable of searching melodies similar to a user query directly from commercial music recordings. In our evaluation with a database of 427 full commercial audio recordings, the method retrieved the correct recording in the topthree list for the 58\% of 159 hummed queries. The method was also top-ranked in “query by singing/humming” task in MIREX 2008 for a database of 2048 MIDI melodies and 2797 queries. The second application uses automatic melody transcription for accompaniment and vocals separation. The transcription also enables tuning the user singing to the original melody in a novel karaoke application.",

    abstract = "Text-to-phoneme (TTP) mapping, also called grapheme-to-phoneme (GTP) conversion, defines the process of transforming a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Text-to-phoneme mapping is a necessary step in any state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) system, where the textual information changes dynamically (i.e., new contact entries for name dialing, or new short messages or emails to be read out by a device). There are significant differences between the implementation requirements of a text-to-phoneme mapping module embedded into the automatic speech recognition and into the text-to-speech systems: in automatic speech recognition systems the errors of the text-to-phoneme mapping module are tolerated better (leading to occasional recognition errors) than in the text-to-speech applications, where the effect is immediately and in all cases audible. Automatic speech recognition systems typically use text-to-phoneme mapping to lower the footprint (to avoid storing the lexicon), while maintaining quality. The use of text-to-phoneme mapping in the text-to-speech systems is different. In addition to the phonetic information, the text-to-speech systems also need prosodic information to be able to produce high quality speech, which cannot be predicted by text-to-phoneme mapping. Most state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems use explicit pronunciation lexicon, which is aimed at providing the widest possible coverage, in the order of 100K words, with high quality pronunciation information. Because of this reason, text-to-phoneme mapping is typically used as a fall-back strategy, when the system encounters very rare or non-native words and the quality of a ext-to-speech system is indirectly affected by the quality of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Another important issue is the question of training the text-to-phoneme mapping module. The problem of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is a static one and such a system is trained off-line. The correspondence between the written and spoken form of a language is usually unchanged in the lifetime of an application. So the complexity/speed of the model training is of secondary importance compared to e.g., the speed of convergence or model size. In this thesis, the problem of text-to-phoneme mapping using neural networks is studied. One of the main goals of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of different neural network structures which can be implemented to convert a written text into its corresponding phonetic transcription. Another important target, of this work, is to provide new solutions that improve the performance of the existing algorithms, in terms of convergence speed and phoneme accuracy. Three main neural network classes are studied in this thesis: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). Due to their ability of self adaptation, neural networks have been shown to be a viable solution in applications that require modeling abilities. Such an application is the text-tophoneme mapping where the correspondence between letters of a written text and their corresponding phonetic transcription must be modeled. One of the main concerns in all practical implementations, where neural networks are used, is to develop algorithms which provide fast convergence of the synaptic weights and in the same time good mapping performances. When a neural network is trained for text-to-phoneme mapping, at every iteration, a letter-phoneme pair is presented to the network such that, the number of letters and the number of training iterations are equal. As a result, fast convergence of the neural network means smaller size of the training dictionary since fast convergence is in fact similar to less necessary training letters1. A fast convergence speed is important in applications where only a small linguistic database is available. Of course, one solution could be to use a small dictionary (with very few words) which is presented at the input of the neural network many times until the convergence of the synaptic weights is reached. In this case the time of training becomes more important. Taking into account these two sides of the convergence speed (the size of the training dictionary and the processing time during training) one can understand the importance of having algorithms that ensure fast convergence of the neural network. It is well known that the error back-propagation algorithm which is used to train the MLP neural network, possess sometimes a quite slow convergence (a very large number of iterations required to reach the stability point). In order to increase the convergence speed two novel alternative solutions are proposed in this thesis: one using an adaptive learning rate in the training process and another which is a transform domain implementation of the multilayer perceptron neural network. The computational complexity of the two proposed training algorithms is slightly higher than the computational complexity of the error back-propagation algorithm but the number of training iterations is highly reduced. Due to this fact, although the three algorithms might have the same training time, the novel algorithms necessitate smaller training dictionary. Due to the limitations of the processing power that usually are encountered in real devices, another very important requirement for a text-to-phoneme mapping system is to have low computational and memory costs. In the case of text-to-phoneme mapping systems based in neural networks, the computational complexity is mainly linked to the mathematical complexity of the training algorithm as well as to the number of the synaptic weights of the neural network. Memory load is due to the number of synaptic weights of the neural network which must be stored. Taking into account all these limitations and implementation requirements, in this thesis, several neural network structures with different number of synaptic weights and trained with various training algorithms, are studied. The modeling capability of the neural networks is addressed, which is translated in the text-to-phoneme mapping case into the phoneme accuracy. Different neural network structures, training algorithms and network complexities are analyzed also from this point of view. As a remark here, we mention that input letter encoding plays a very important role in the phoneme accuracy of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system. This is why special attention has been paid to the comparative analysis of the performances (in terms of phoneme accuracy) obtained with several orthogonal and non-orthogonal encoding of the input letters. The thesis is structured into four main parts. Chapter 1 brings the reader into the world of text-to-phoneme mapping. In Chapter 2 several different neural network structures and their corresponding training algorithms are described and two new training algorithms are introduced and analyzed. In Chapter 3 the experimental results, for the problem of monolingual text-to-phoneme mapping, obtained with the neural networks described in Chapter 2 are shown. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the problem of bilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and Chapter 5 concludes the thesis.",

Experimental material consisted of 5286 single notes from Western orchestral instruments, the timbre of which have been studied in great depth. The literature review part of this thesis introduces the studies on the sound of musical instruments, as well as related knowledge on instrument acoustics. Together with the state-of-the-art in automatic sound source recognition systems, these form the foundation for the most important part of this thesis: the extraction of perceptually relevant features from acoustic musical signals. Several different feature extraction algorithms were implemented and developed, and used as a front-end for a pattern recognition system. The performance of the system was evaluated in several experiments. Using feature vectors that included cepstral coefﬁcients and features relating to the type of excitation, brightness, modulations, asynchronity and fundamental frequency of tones, an accuracy of 35 \% was obtained on a database including several examples of 29 instruments. The recognition of the family of the instrument between six possible classes was successful in 77 \% of the cases. The performance of the system and the confusions it made were compared to the results reported for human perception. The comparison shows that the performance of the system is worse than that of humans in a similar task (46 \% in individual instrument and 92 \% in instrument family recognition [Martin99]), although it is comparable to the performance of other reported systems. Confusions of the system resemble those of human subjects, indicating that the feature extraction algorithms have managed to capture perceptually relevant information from the acoustic signals.",

    abstract = "Signal processing methods for audio classification and music content analysis are developed in this thesis. Audio classification is here understood as the process of assigning a discrete category label to an unknown recording. Two specific problems of audio classification are considered: musical instrument recognition and context recognition. In the former, the system classifies an audio recording according to the instrument, e.g. violin, flute, piano, that produced the sound. The latter task is about classifying an environment, such a car, restaurant, or library, based on its ambient audio background. In the field of music content analysis, methods are presented for music meter analysis and chorus detection. Meter analysis methods consider the estimation of the regular pattern of strong and weak beats in a piece of music. The goal of chorus detection is to locate the chorus segment in music which is often the catchiest and most memorable part of a song. These are among the most important and readily commercially applicable content attributes that can be automatically analyzed from music signals. For audio classification, several features and classification methods are proposed and evaluated. In musical instrument recognition, we consider methods to improve the performance of a baseline audio classification system that uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and their first derivatives as features, and continuous-density hidden Markov models (HMMs) for modeling the feature distributions. Two improvements are proposed to increase the performance of this baseline system. First, transforming the features to a base with maximal statistical independence using independent component analysis. Secondly, discriminative training is shown to further improve the recognition accuracy of the system. For musical meter analysis, three methods are proposed. The first performs meter analysis jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level, which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. The features obtained from an accent feature analyzer and a bank of combfilter resonators are processed by a novel probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and performs joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses. The second method focuses on estimating the beat and the tatum. The design goal was to keep the method computationally very efficient while retaining sufficient analysis accuracy. Simplified probabilistic modeling is proposed for beat and tatum period and phase estimation, and ensuring the continuity of the estimates. A novel phase-estimator based on adaptive comb filtering is presented. The accuracy of the method is close to the first method but with a fraction of the computational cost. The third method for music rhythm analysis focuses on improving the accuracy in music tempo estimation. The method is based on estimating the tempo of periodicity vectors using locally weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression. Regression closely relates to classification, the difference being that the goal of regression is to estimate the value of a continuous variable (the tempo), whereas in classification the value to be assigned is a discrete category label. We propose a resampling step applied to an unknown periodicity vector before finding the nearest neighbors to increase the likelihood of finding a good match from the training set. This step improves the performance of the method significantly. The tempo estimate is computed as a distance-weighted median of the nearest neighbor tempi. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significantly better tempo estimation accuracies than three reference methods. Finally, we describe a computationally efficient method for detecting a chorus section in popular and rock music. The method utilizes a self-dissimilarity representation that is obtained by summing two separate distance matrices calculated using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient and pitch chroma features. This is followed by the detection of off-diagonal segments of small distance in the distance matrix. From the detected segments, an initial chorus section is selected using a scoring mechanism utilizing several heuristics, and subjected to further processing.",

    abstract = "An acoustic environment surrounding a listener, an auditory scene, can provide contextual cues that enable the recognition of the scene. This thesis concerns the problem of computational auditory scene recognition, which is a subproblem of computational auditory scene analysis. Computational auditory scene analysis refers to the computational analysis of an acoustic environment, and the recognition of distinct sound events in it. In this study, the focus is not in analyzing and recognizing discrete sound events (although they may be used in the recognition process), but in the classiﬁcation of acoustic environments as whole. This thesis covers all the different phases of a study that was made at the Signal Processing Laboratory of Tampere University of Technology: a literature review on auditory scene recognition and related ﬁelds of research, acoustic measurements that were made in a number of everyday auditory environments, design and implementation of the audio database access software, a listening test examining human abilities in auditory scene recognition, audio signal classiﬁcation theory, algorithm development and simulations. The core of this thesis is in the computational audio classiﬁcation and signal processing algorithm development part. Auditory scene recognition involves correct grouping of similar environments, feature selection and extraction, and the use of a suitable classiﬁcation algorithm. A crucial step in solving the problem is to determine appropriate features that can discriminatebetween the acoustic data associated with pre-deﬁned scene classes. The conducted listening tests show that, on average, humans are able to recognize 25 different scenes with 70 \% accuracy. The scenes included everyday outside and inside environments,such as streets, market places, restaurants, and family homes. The performance of the computational classiﬁcation methods was investigated by conducting Matlab simulations. The bestobtained recognition rate for 13 different scenes was 56\%, where the classiﬁed scenes wereselected so that from each one there were at least three recordings from different locations. We also did an experiment of recognizing more general classes (meta-classes), and for certain categorizations of the scenes we obtained relatively good classiﬁcation results. For example, themeta-class car vs. other was classiﬁed correctly in 95\% of the cases.",

    abstract = "Exemplar-based speech enhancement systems work by decomposing the noisy speech as a weighted sum of speech and noise exemplars stored in a dictionary and use the resulting speech and noise estimates to obtain a time-varying filter in the full-resolution frequency domain to enhance the noisy speech. To obtain the decomposition, exemplars sampled in lower dimensional spaces are preferred over the full-resolution frequency domain for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize to unseen cases. But the resulting filter may be sub-optimal as the mapping of the obtained speech and noise estimates to the full-resolution frequency domain yields a low-rank approximation. This paper proposes an efficient way to directly compute the full-resolution frequency estimates of speech and noise using coupled dictionaries: an input dictionary containing atoms from the desired exemplar space to obtain the decomposition and a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars from the full-resolution frequency domain. We also introduce modulation spectrogram features for the exemplar-based tasks using this approach. The proposed system was evaluated for various choices of input exemplars and yielded improved speech enhancement performances on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 databases. We further show that the proposed approach also results in improved word error rates (WERs) for the speech recognition tasks using HMM-GMM and deep-neural network (DNN) based systems.",

    abstract = "The interest in modulation classification has recently emerged in the research of communication systems. This has been due to the advances in reconfigurable signal processing systems, especially in the study of software radio. Published methods can be divided into two groups: maximum likelihood and pattern recognition approaches. In the maximum likelihood approach, decision rules are often simple but the test statistics are complicated and assume prior knowledge about the signals. In the pattern recognition approach, decision rules are often complicated whereas the features are simple and fast to calculate. Communication signals contain a vast amount of uncertainty due to the unknown modulating signal, modulation type, and noise. Therefore the modulation classification problem has to be approached by using statistical methods. The features and the test statistics may be derived from the known statistical characteristics of the modulated signals. Either implicit or explicit use of higher-order statistics has been studied previously in many communication applications. The higher-order statistics are often more preferable because second-order statistics suppress the phase information of the signal. Nevertheless, the estimation of the higher-order statistics requires long sample sets and has a high computational complexity. To overcome these problems, second-order cyclostationary statistics have been studied and the results seem promising. In this thesis, the feature extraction problem of the modulation classification is discussed. Useful characteristics and representations of the communication signals are presented as well as the relevant knowledge of statistical signal processing. The previous methods are presented in a literature review of the modulation classification. The first and second-order statistics including the cyclostationary statistics of digital modulated signals are studied, and a novel feature is proposed. Some previous methods and this novel feature are compared by investigating their discrimination performance in Matlab simulations.",

VAD is assumed to give additional information to the ASR system about the presence of speech, thus increasing the robustness of the ASR system. Two standard VAD algorithms (G.729b and GSM) are described and a statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based VAD is introduced. For the GMM based VAD, different adaptation techniques are employed to track the changing background noise statistics. The VAD algorithms are integrated with the ASR system, with explicit and implicit approaches. The explicit approach means that the VAD is a separate module in the front end of the ASR system, while in the implicit approach the VAD decision is included in the decoding stage of the speech recognition unit. The performance of the VAD algorithms are compared directly using frame classification rates and indirectly using recognition rates. Recognition is performed as a small vocabulary isolated word recognition task with a Hidden Model based ASR system using normalized Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. According to our simulations, ideal information about the word boundaries increases significantly the recognition accuracy of the ASR system. However, the described VAD algorithms were not able to increase the recognition accuracy significantly.",

    abstract = "This thesis concerns the problem of automatic recognition of a person based on his or her voice. The main objective is on the text-independent speaker identification task. A few different feature extraction algorithms are presented and evaluated using the KING and POLYCOST speech corpora. The principal feature used are the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, but also other feature sets are considered including the spectral slope and the fundamental frequency.The work concentrates mostly on different classification algorithms used in speaker recognition. The biggest attention is on the Gaussian mixture speaker models (GMM) which have been widely used in many text-independent speaker recognition studies. Conventionally, the GMM parameters are trained with the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. An identification accuracy of 95.8\% is achieved using this method for a population of 25 speakers with 60 seconds of training speech and a test sequence of 5 seconds.A drawback of the conventional EM training is the need for selecting the number of the mixture components, i.e. the model order, before the actual training procedure. Moreover, the number of components is usually the same for each speaker. The most important part of this thesis concerns simultaneous order selection and parameter training of GMMs. We evaluate a couple of recently proposed algorithms capable of selecting the order of each speaker model individually during a single training procedure. The algorithms provide a straightforward way of adjusting the number of components of each GMM to the acoustic characteristics and amount of available training data for each speaker. The methods are based on integrating some model complexity criterion, such as the minimum descripition length, into the EM training process. It is observed that when the amount of available training data varies between speakers, a relative reduction of 13\% in error rate is obtained using an algorithm proposed by Figueiredo and Jain [Figueiredo02]. If the speech samples are recorded over a telephone line, a reduction of 11\% in error rate is observed using the agglomerative EM algorithm [Figueiredo99].",

In this thesis, we are studying content-based classification of acoustic musical signals according to their musical genre (e.g., classical, rock) and the instruments used. A listening experiment is conducted to study human abilities to recognise musical genres. This thesis covers a literature review on human musical genre recognition, state-of-the-art musical genre recognition systems, and related fields of research. In addition, a general-purpose music database consisting of recordings and their manual annotations is introduced. The theory behind the used features and classifiers is reviewed and the results from the simulations are presented. The developed musical genre recognition system uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to represent the time-varying magnitude spectrum of a music signal. The class-conditional feature densities are modelled with hidden Markov models. Musical instrument detection for a few pitched instruments from music signals is also studied using the same structure. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a method for the detection of drum instruments. The presence of drums is determined based on the periodicity of the amplitude envelopes of the signal at subbands. The conducted listening experiment shows that the recognition of musical genres is not a trivial task even for humans. On the average, humans are able to recognise the correct genre in 75 \% of cases (given five-second samples). Results also indicate that humans can do rather accurate musical genre recognition without long-term temporal features, such as rhythm. For the developed automatic recognition system, the obtained recognition accuracy for six musical genres was around 60 \%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems. Detection accuracy of 81 \% was obtained with the proposed drum instrument detection method.",

The excitations are restricted to harmonic spectra and their fundamental frequencies are estimated in advance using a multipitch estimator, whereas the filters are restricted to have smooth frequency responses by modeling them as a sum of elementary functions on the Mel-frequency scale. The pitch and timbre information are used in organizing individual notes into sound sources. In the recognition, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used to represent the coarse shape of the power spectrum of sound sources and Gaussian mixture models are used to model instrument-conditional densities of the extracted features.

Humans are using context information to make more accurate predictions about the sound events and ruling out unlikely events given the context. We propose a similar utilization of context information in the automatic sound event detection process. The proposed approach is composed of two stages: automatic context recognition stage and sound event detection stage. Contexts are modeled using Gaussian mixture models and sound events are modeled using three-state left-to-right hidden Markov models. In the first stage, audio context of the tested signal is recognized. Based on the recognized context, a context-specific set of sound event classes is selected for the sound event detection stage. The event detection stage also uses context-dependent acoustic models and count-based event priors. Two alternative event detection approaches are studied. In the first one, a monophonic event sequence is outputted by detecting the most prominent sound event at each time instance using Viterbi decoding. The second approach introduces a new method for producing polyphonic event sequence by detecting multiple overlapping sound events using multiple restricted Viterbi passes. A new metric is introduced to evaluate the sound event detection performance with various level of polyphony. This combines the detection accuracy and coarse time-resolution error into one metric, making the comparison of the performance of detection algorithms simpler. The two-step approach was found to improve the results substantially compared to the context-independent baseline system. In the block-level, the detection accuracy can be almost doubled by using the proposed context-dependent event detection.",

The presented approach creates audio textures by processing a small amount of audio recorded at a given location, providing a cost-effective way to produce a versatile audio signal that characterizes the location. The resulting texture is non-repetitive and conserves the location-specific characteristics of the audio scene, without the need of collecting large amount of audio from each location. The method consists of two stages: analysis and synthesis. In the analysis stage, the source audio recording is segmented into homogeneous segments. In the synthesis stage, the audio texture is created by randomly drawing segments from the source audio so that the consecutive segments will have timbral similarity near the segment boundaries. Results obtained in listening experiments show that there is no statistically significant difference in the audio quality or location-specificity of audio when the created audio textures are compared to excerpts of the original recordings.

    abstract = "This thesis proposes algorithms to be utilized for iterative design of linear filters and for adaptive polynomial filtering. The goal is to improve existing algorithms in terms of filtering performance, time and complexity requirements. First, a family of fast algorithms suitable for adaptive polynomial filtering, namely LS-LMS algorithm and its square root variants, is introduced and its connection with the family of RLS algorithms is analyzed. The algorithms are derived by combining the triangularization and backsolving steps of QR-RLS algorithm. In the derivation we allow a modification of the cost function in order to decrease the complexity of the algorithm from O(M^2) to O(M), where M is the number of filter parameters. Second, adaptive filtering algorithms are proposed for the problem of acoustic echo control in the case of strong acoustic distortion in the loudspeaker that decreases the echo attenuation obtained using adaptive linear filtering algorithms in echo cancelers. Several existing algorithms were tested using both linear and homogeneous Volterra filters, but their performance was not found satisfactory either in terms of performance or complexity. A polynomial preprocessor followed by a linear filter was found to perform well when the preprocessor was adapted by the robust, but computationally demanding, QR-RLS algorithm and the linear part was adapted by the normalized LMS algorithm. Third, the problem of optimum energy compaction for FIR and IIR filters is addressed. The analytical method for optimum compaction FIR filter design is analyzed and shown to provide a very fast algorithm under certain conditions. For the design of optimum compaction IIR filters two new methods are proposed. The first design method operates with the numerator and the denominator in the causal part of the associated product filter, which are in turn optimized via iterative relaxations. The second method is similar, except that the angles of the poles are set to fixed values, situated at the transitions in the frequency representation of the corresponding ideal brickwall filter. Thus, the second method is faster than the first, and, moreover, it was observed that when the ideal brickwall filter does not have too many transitions, the second method provides filters with better performance. Both methods make use of semidefinite programming optimization using an appropriate parameterization of positive real polynomials. The last part of the thesis provides contributions to the frequency selective IIR filter design. The frequency response of the filter is fitted to an ideal frequency response by optimizing either a weighted sum of magnitude squares (least squares) criterion or a minimax (Chebyshev) criterion. For the least squares criterion a new convex stability domain is used and experimental evidence is given that the best designs are usually obtained with a multistage algorithm where three methods, Steiglitz-McBride, Gauss-Newton and classical descent, are used consecutively in that order. The result of multistage least squares IIR design is used to initialize the optimization procedure based on a Chebyshev criterion, for which a simplified iterative procedure is proposed. In the simplified procedure only the numerator is updated after initialization. The simplified procedure is compared experimentally with the complete procedure and the results show only very small differences in the criterion.",

The purpose of decomposing an audio spectrogram using spectral templates is to learn the underlying structures (audio objects) from the observed data. The chapter discusses two main scenarios such as parameterization of multichannel surround sound and parameterization of microphone array signals. It explains the principles of source separation by time-frequency filtering using separation masks constructed from the spectrogram models. The chapter introduces a spatial covariance matrix model based on the directions of arrival of sound events and spectral templates, and discusses its relationship to conventional spatial audio signal processing. Source separation using spectrogram factorization models is achieved via time- frequency filtering of the original observation short-time Fourier transform (STFT) by a generalized Wiener filter obtained from the spectrogram model parameters.",

The creation of a dataset for this task requires a considerable amount of work, rendering the crowdsourcing a very attractive option. In this paper we present a three steps based framework for crowdsourcing an audio captioning dataset, based on concepts and practises followed for the creation of widely used image captioning and machine translations datasets. During the first step initial captions are gathered. A grammatically corrected and/or rephrased version of each initial caption is obtained in second step. Finally, the initial and edited captions are rated, keeping the top ones for the produced dataset. We objectively evaluate the impact of our framework during the process of creating an audio captioning dataset, in terms of diversity and amount of typographical errors in the obtained captions. The obtained results show that the resulting dataset has less typographical errors than the initial captions, and on average each sound in the produced dataset has captions with a Jaccard similarity of 0.24, roughly equivalent to two ten-word captions having in common four words with the same root, indicating that the captions are dissimilar while they still contain some of the same information.},

    abstract = "This thesis proposes signal processing methods for the analysis of musical audio on two time scales: drum transcription on a ﬁner time scale and music structure analysis on the time scale of entire pieces. The former refers to the process of locating drum sounds in the input and recognising the instruments that were used to produce the sounds. The latter refers to the temporal segmentation of a musical piece into parts, such as chorus and verse. For drum transcription, both low-level acoustic recognition and high-level musicological modelling methods are presented. A baseline acoustic recognition method with a large number of features using Gaussian mixture models for the recognition of drum combinations is presented. Since drums occur in structured patterns, modelling of the sequential dependencies with N-grams is proposed. In addition to the conventional N-grams, periodic N-grams are proposed to model the dependencies between events that occur one pattern length apart. The evaluations show that incorporating musicological modelling improves the performance considerably. As some drums are more probable to occur at certain points in a pattern, this dependency is utilised for producing transcriptions of signals produced with arbitrary sounds, such as beatboxing. A supervised source separation method using non-negative matrix factorisation is proposed for transcribing mixtures of drum sounds. Despite the simple signal model, a high performance is obtained for signals without other instruments. Most of the drum transcription methods operate only on single-channel inputs, but multichannel signals are available in recording studios. A multichannel extension of the source separation method is proposed, and an increase in performance is observed in evaluations. Many of the drum transcription methods rely on detecting sound onsets for the segmentation of the signal. Detection errors will then decrease the overall performance of the system. To overcome this problem, a method utilising a network of connected hidden Markov models is proposed to perform the event segmentation and recognition jointly. The system is shown to be able to perform the transcription even from polyphonic music. The second main topic of this thesis is music structure analysis. Two methods are proposed for this purpose. The ﬁrst relies on deﬁning a cost function for a description of the repeated parts. The second method deﬁnes a ﬁtness function for descriptions covering the entire piece. The abstract cost (and ﬁtness) functions are formulated in terms that can be determined from the input signal algorithmically, and optimisation problems are formulated. In both cases, an algorithm is proposed for solving the optimisation problems. The ﬁrst method is evaluated on a small data set, and the relevance of the cost function terms is shown. The latter method is evaluated on three large data sets with a total of 831 (557+174+100) songs. This is to date the largest evaluation of a structure analysis method. The evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms a reference system on two of the data sets. Music structure analysis methods rarely provide musically meaningful names for the parts in the result. A method is proposed to label the parts in descriptions based on a statistical model of the sequential dependencies between musical parts. The method is shown to label the main parts relatively reliably without any additional information. The labelling model is further integrated into the ﬁtness function based structure analysis method.",

    abstract = "This thesis concerns the development and evaluation of signal processing methods that compensate for the hearing disorders caused by ageing. The global ageing increases the number of elderly people with hearing impairment. In most cases this impairment is irrecoverable and cannot be medically or surgically treated. The only option is to process the sound going to the ear, so that it would be as clear and intelligible as possible. The multichannel dynamic compression is such a processing. With the multichannel compression the need for amplified sound and the problems of redused dynamic range can be solved. The compression reduces the loudness fluctuations in the sound so that when sound is amplified, loud sounds do not sound too loud. As a degree of the hearing impairment is more severe in high frequency bands and by processing the bands individually. In this work, I have implemented a three- channel dynamic compression system controllable in real-time. The system was used to conduct listening tests for hearing impaired: The goal was to found a relationship between the audiogram (which represents the hearing threshold level and uncomfortable listening level measured by using sinusoids as stimuli) and the parameters of the multichannel dynamic compression system. In the first listening test, only a week relationship between the two was found. A second test was conducted in order to find out if the adjusted parameter were actually the most intelligible. This was realised using a paired comparison test. In this tests, four different processing were compared. The results shows that the spectral shaping was judged to be the processing which made speech the most intelligible. The compression was disliked and the possible reason for this is that the stimuli were very intelligible and power-normalised already before processing. There was no room for further improvement in intelligibility and thus the distortions caused by compression were perceived unpleasant",

    abstract = "This thesis studies several data decomposition algorithms for obtaining an object-based representation of an audio signal. The estimation of the representation parameters are coupled with audio-specific criteria, such as the spectral redundancy, sparsity, perceptual relevance and spatial position of sounds. The objective is to obtain an audio signal representation that is composed of meaningful entities called audio objects that reflect the properties of real-world sound objects and events. The estimation of the object-based model is based on magnitude spectrogram redundancy using non-negative matrix factorization with extensions to multichannel and complex-valued data. The benefits of working with object-based audio representations over the conventional time-frequency bin-wise processing are studied. The two main applications of the object-based audio representations proposed in this thesis are spatial audio coding and sound source separation from multichannel microphone array recordings. In the proposed spatial audio coding algorithm, the audio objects are estimated from the multichannel magnitude spectrogram. The audio objects are used for recovering the content of each original channel from a single downmixed signal, using time-frequency filtering. The perceptual relevance of modeling the audio signal is considered in the estimation of the parameters of the object-based model, and the sparsity of the model is utilized in encoding its parameters. Additionally, a quantization of the model parameters is proposed that reflects the perceptual relevance of each quantized element. The proposed object-based spatial audio coding algorithm is evaluated via listening tests and comparing the overall perceptual quality to conventional time-frequency block-wise methods at the same bitrates. The proposed approach is found to produce comparable coding efficiency while providing additional functionality via the object-based coding domain representation, such as the blind separation of the mixture of sound sources in the encoded channels. For the sound source separation from multichannel audio recorded by a microphone array, a method combining an object-based magnitude model and spatial covariance matrix estimation is considered. A direction of arrival-based model for the spatial covariance matrices of the sound sources is proposed. Unlike the conventional approaches, the estimation of the parameters of the proposed spatial covariance matrix model ensures a spatially coherent solution for the spatial parameterization of the sound sources. The separation quality is measured with objective criteria and the proposed method is shown to improve over the state-of-the-art sound source separation methods, with recordings done using a small microphone array.",

    abstract = "Singing voice separation based on deep learning relies on the usage of time-frequency masking. In many cases the masking process is not a learnable function or is not encapsulated into the deep learning optimization. Consequently, most of the existing methods rely on a post processing step using the generalized Wiener filtering. This work proposes a method that learns and optimizes (during training) a source-dependent mask and does not need the aforementioned post processing step. We introduce a recurrent inference algorithm, a sparse transformation step to improve the mask generation process, and a learned denoising filter. Obtained results show an increase of 0.49 dB for the signal to distortion ratio and 0.30 dB for the signal to interference ratio, compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for monaural singing voice separation.",

In this paper, we propose a new cost function with the aim of optimizing the extended short time objective intelligibility (ESTOI) measure. We focus on applications where low algorithmic latency (≤ 10 ms) is important. We use long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and evaluate our proposed approach on four sets of two-speaker mixtures from extended Danish hearing in noise (HINT) dataset. We show that the proposed loss function can offer improved or at par objective intelligibility (in terms of ESTOI) compared to an MSE optimized baseline while resulting in lower objective separation performance (in terms of the source to distortion ratio (SDR)). We then proceed to propose an approach where the network is first initialized with weights optimized for MSE criterion and then trained with the proposed ESTOI loss criterion. This approach mitigates some of the losses in objective separation performance while preserving the gains in objective intelligibility.",

It consists of training word-specific binary classifiers on a collected dataset of isolated words with possible pronunciation errors, typical for Finnish native speakers. The classifiers predict whether the typical error is present in the given word utterance. They operate on sequences of acoustic features, extracted from consecutive frames of an audio recording of a word utterance. The proposed architecture includes a convolutional neural network, a recurrent neural network, or a combination of the two. The optimal topology and hyperpa-rameters are obtained in a Bayesian optimisation setting using a tree-structured Parzen estimator. A dataset of 80 words uttered naturally by 120 speakers is collected. The performance of the proposed system, evaluated on a well-represented subset of the dataset, shows that it is capable of detecting pronunciation errors in most of the words (46/49) with high accuracy (mean accuracy gain over the zero rule 12.21 percent points).",

We propose to explore more exhaustively those algorithms, in particular the choice of the methodology (standard EM or SAGE variant) and the latent variable set (full or reduced). We then derive four EM-based algorithms, among which three are novel.

We present in detail each task and analyse the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks.

Sinusoids plus noise model is a spectral model, in which the periodic components of the sound are represented with sinusoids with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes and phases. The remaining non-periodic components are represented with a ﬁltered noise. The sinusoidal model utilizes the physical properties of musical instruments and the noise model the humans’ inability to perceive the exact spectral shape or phase of stochastic signals. In the case of polyphonic music signals, the estimation of the parameters of sinusoids is a difficult task, since the periodic components are usually not stable. A sufficient time and frequency resolution is also difficult to achieve at the same time. A big part of this thesis discusses the detection and parameter estimation of periodic components with several algorithms. In addition to already existing algorithms, a new iterative algorithm is presented, which is based on the fusion of closely spaced sinusoids. The sinusoidal model is applied in the separation of overlapping sounds and manipulation. In the sound separation, a new perceptual distance measure between sinusoids is used. The perceptual distance measure is based on the humans’ way to associate spectral components into sound sources. Also a new separation method based on the multipitch estimation is explained. The modification of the pitch and time scale of sounds with the sinusoid plus noise model without affecting the quality of the sound is explained shortly, too.",

    abstract = "Sound source separation refers to the task of estimating the signals produced by individual sound sources from a complex acoustic mixture. It has several applications, since monophonic signals can be processed more eﬃciently and ﬂexibly than polyphonic mixtures. This thesis deals with the separation of monaural, or, one-channel music recordings. We concentrate on separation methods, where the sources to be separated are not known beforehand. Instead, the separation is enabled by utilizing the common properties of real-world sound sources, which are their continuity, sparseness, and repetition in time and frequency, and their harmonic spectral structures. One of the separation approaches taken here use unsupervised learning and the other uses model-based inference based on sinusoidal modeling. Most of the existing unsupervised separation algorithms are based on a linear instantaneous signal model, where each frame of the input mixture signal is modeled as a weighted sum of basis functions. We review the existing algorithms which use independent component analysis, sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization to estimate the basis functions from an input mixture signal. Our proposed unsupervised separation algorithm based on the instantaneous model combines non-negative matrix factorization with sparseness and temporal continuity objectives. The algorithm is based on minimizing the reconstruction error between the magnitude spectrogram of the observed signal and the model, while restricting the basis functions and their gains to non-negative values, and the gains to be sparse and continuous in time. In the minimization, we consider iterative algorithms which are initialized with random values and updated so that the value of the total objective cost function decreases at each iteration. Both multiplicative update rules and a steepest descent algorithm are proposed for this task. To improve the convergence of the projected steepest descent algorithm, we propose an augmented divergence to measure the reconstruction error. Simulation experiments on generated mixtures of pitched instruments and drums were run to monitor the behavior of the proposed method. The proposed method enables average signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) of 7.3 dB, which is higher than the SDRs obtained with the other tested methods based on the instantaneous signal model. To enable separating entities which correspond better to real-world sound objects, we propose two convolutive signal models which can be used to represent time-varying spectra and fundamental frequencies. We propose unsupervised learning algorithms extended from non-negative matrix factorization for estimating the model parameters from a mixture signal. The objective in them is to minimize the reconstruction error between the magnitude spectrogram of the observed signal and the model while restricting the parameters to non-negative values. Simulation experiments show that time-varying spectra enable better separation quality of drum sounds, and time-varying frequencies representing diﬀerent fundamental frequency values of pitched instruments conveniently. Another class of studied separation algorithms is based on the sinusoidal model, where the periodic components of a signal are represented as the sum of sinusoids with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. The model provides a good representation for pitched instrument sounds, and the robustness of the parameter estimation is here increased by restricting the sinusoids of each source to harmonic frequency relationships. Our proposed separation algorithm based on sinusoidal modeling minimizes the reconstruction error between the observed signal and the model. Since the rough shape of spectrum of natural sounds is continuous as a function of frequency, the amplitudes of overlapping overtones can be approximated by interpolating from adjacent overtones, for which we propose several methods. Simulation experiments on generated mixtures of pitched musical instruments show that the proposed methods allow average SDR above 15 dB for two simultaneous sources, and the quality decreases gradually as the number of sources increases.",

    abstract = "Personal multimedia databases contain thousands of items and other databases on the Internet may contain even billions of items. Finding a particular item manually from such databases becomes overwhelming and thus automatic search engines are required to lighten the job. Query by example refers to automatically finding multimedia items from a database, which are similar to the example provided by the user. This is an important task in modern multimedia databases. This thesis deals with automatic query by example of audio samples. The emphasis is on representation and distance measures between two audio signals, which are used to estimate the similarity between these two signals. The thesis also covers computational issues, which are highly important when it comes to practical implementation of the algorithms. Two different audio signal representations are proposed. These representations are interconnected, since the first separates drums from a polyphonic music signal although the same approach could be used to separate other parts of the original signal as well, for example, harmonic instruments. The second representation models the harmonic sound using only a few parameters. The proposed method is based on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, which are further modeled using attack-decay-sustain-release curves with temporal evolution of harmonic instruments. Most distance measures, used in audio signal processing, are based on dividing a signal into frames, extracting perceptually motivated features from each frame, and calculating the distance between the features. Most of the proposed distance measures use Gaussian mixture models to estimate the probability density functions of the framewise features and calculate the distance between the Gaussian mixture models. However, the thesis also introduces a parameter free distance measurement. This is based on compression ratios of audio signals and i hence it removes the user influence on the results, since no features or other parameters need to be set. In a query by example application, the similarity between the example provided by the user and each database item need to be calculated in order to obtain a ranked list of database samples. However, in practical applications this operation is very time-consuming if the database contains millions of items. The proposed method applies keysample transformation to reduce the series of feature vectors, used to represent each signal, into a single feature vector. The database is then clustered and the search is restricted to only a few clusters, thus saving retrieval time with some loss of accuracy.",

Whilst this separation of tasks is useful for problem definition, they inherently ignore some subtleties of the real-world, in particular how humans vary in how they describe a scene. Some will describe the weather and features within it, others will use a holistic descriptor like `park', and others still will use unique identifiers such as cities or names. In this paper, we undertake the task of automatic city classification to ask whether we can recognize a city from a set of sound scenes? In this problem each city has recordings from multiple scenes. We test a series of methods for this novel task and show that a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve accuracy of 50\%. This is less than the acoustic scene classification task baseline in the DCASE 2018 ASC challenge on the same data. A simple adaptation to the class labels of pairing city labels with grouped scenes, accuracy increases to 52\%, closer to the simpler scene classification task. Finally we also formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework and achieve an accuracy of 56\%, outperforming the aforementioned approaches.",

We propose a novel multichannel NMF model with time-varying mixing of the sources denoted by spatial covariance matrices (SCM) and provide update equations for optimizing model parameters minimizing squared Frobenius norm. The SCMs of the model are obtained based on estimated directions of arrival of tracked sources at each time frame. The evaluation is based on established objective separation criteria and using real recordings of two and three simultaneous moving sound sources. The compared methods include conventional beamforming and ideal ratio mask separation.

We use the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for estimating the filter parameters due to its fast convergence rate, which is required for modeling rapidly changing RIRs of moving sound sources. The proposed method allows separation of reverberated sources from the far-field mixture given that their close-field signals are available. The evaluation is based on measuring unmixing performance (removal of reverberated source) using objective separation criteria calculated between the ground truth recording of the preserved sources and the unmixing result obtained with the proposed algorithm.

    abstract = "Voice conversion is a speech technology encompassing transformations applied to the speech signal with the purpose of changing the perceived speaker identity from a source voice to a desired target voice. The principal use of voice conversion is to enable synthesis systems to generate speech with customized voices without need for exhaustive recordings and processing. Voice conversion can be realized as a stand-alone task or alternatively, using adaptation techniques with HMM-based synthesis. Although there are many speaker-dependent voice characteristics, voice conversion deals mainly with those acoustic in nature such as the spectral characteristics and the fundamental frequency. In spite of the remarkable results achieved by the state of the art techniques, further challenges remain to be solved in all sub-areas of voice conversion in order to provide excellent quality and highly successful identity conversion. The objective of this thesis is to develop a stand-alone voice conversion system for coded speech and to propose solutions leading to better quality, versatility or efficiency compared to current techniques. The thesis is focused on the conversion of spectral envelopes but other sub-areas of voice conversion such as speech parameterization or alignment are also treated. The analysis-modification-synthesis system adopted in this thesis is based on a parametric speech model used in a real speech codec but also for the internal speech representation of a concatenative TTS system. This allows an easy integration of voice conversion with communications related and embedded applications developed for coded speech. The validity of this parameterization has been confirmed by using it in an actual voice conversion scheme. In addition, a voicing level control scheme, a speech enhancement technique and a method for automatic speech data collection have been proposed, all of them taking advantage of this parametric framework. The versatility of voice conversion systems depends on the characteristics imposed on the training data in order to properly estimate a conversion function. Depending on the characteristics of the training data different alignment strategies can be adopted. Although dynamic time warping (DTW) has become almost a standard for the alignment of parallel training data, a new soft alignment technique is proposed for the same purpose. This concept allows probabilistic one-to-many frame mapping and is proven valid in an experiment with an artificial example. For practical reasons the non-parallel case has been attracting increased interest lately. In this thesis, two techniques for text independent alignment are proposed. The first one is based on phonetic segmentation and temporal decomposition and was successfully used in a voice conversion application. The second method uses a TTS to break the non-parallel problem into two parallel conversions which concatenated realize the desired voice conversion. GMM-based techniques have been the most popular approach for the conversion of spectral envelopes in spite of their problems related to over-smoothing, over-fitting and the lack of temporal modeling. In order to address these issues and improve the GMM-based voice conversion, this thesis introduces several techniques. First, a new measure of the conversion accuracy is proposed, which can be easily computed from the GMM parameters, and is found to be in line with perceptual and objective metrics. The next technique combines a clustering and mode selection scheme with cluster-wise GMM modeling and is based on the observation that the mapping accuracy improves with the reduction of target data variance. The proposed technique is shown to outperform a comparable approach that uses voicing based clustering. A third technique can be used to adapt an existing well-trained conversion model to a new target speaker using a small amount of data. In a practical evaluation the adapted model outperformed an equivalent model trained exclusively on the reduced data. The continuity issue is addressed in a final idea proposed for future research. In general the spectral conversion techniques proposed in the literature have been subject to a tradeoff between speech quality and identity conversion and the challenge remains to provide optimal results for both criteria simultaneously. A new spectral conversion technique introduced in this thesis uses bilinear models to decompose the line spectral frequencies (LSF) representation of the spectral envelope into two factors corresponding to speaker identity and phonetic content respectively. In an extensive evaluation on different types and for different sizes of training data this approach was found to perform similarly to a GMM-based conversion even though, in contrast to the GMM, it does not require any tuning. The concepts of contextual and local modeling are also introduced arguing that a more accurate mapping can be achieved if multiple models are fit on relatively small subsets of the full training data rather than using one global model. The validity of the concepts has been verified in practical experiments. Furthermore, a local linear transformation technique is shown to effectively reduce the over-smoothing relatively to a globally trained GMM-based conversion function. For spectral conversion, several of the proposed techniques can be considered extensions of a baseline vector quantization framework, opening the way for further developments in this direction. In addition to the local linear transformation method which can be easily integrated in this framework, a memory efficient conversion scheme based on multi-stage vector quantization (MSVQ) was also proposed. The experiments indicated substantial memory savings and even accuracy improvement compared to some conventional codebook conversions. A dynamic programming approach to optimizing the frame to frame continuity in a vector quantization framework is also proposed as a future direction. A final contribution is brought to the existing hybrid technique that combines GMM and frequency warping. The approach is adapted to work with the proposed speech representation and a procedure for automatic formant alignment and warping function calculation is presented.",

We examine the mapping functions of neural networks based on the denoising autoencoder (DAE) model that are conditioned on the mixture magnitude spectra. To approximate the mapping functions, we propose an algorithm inspired by the knowledge distillation, denoted the neural couplings algorithm (NCA). The NCA yields a matrix that expresses the mapping of the mixture to the target source magnitude information. Using the NCA, we examine the mapping functions of three fundamental DAE-based models in music source separation; one with single-layer encoder and decoder, one with multi-layer encoder and single-layer decoder, and one using skip-filtering connections (SF) with a single-layer encoding and decoding. We first train these models with realistic data to estimate the singing voice magnitude spectra from the corresponding mixture. We then use the optimized models and test spectral data as input to the NCA. Our experimental findings show that approaches based on the DAE model learn scalar filtering operators, exhibiting a predominant diagonal structure in their corresponding mapping functions, limiting the exploitation of inter-frequency structure of music data. In contrast, skip-filtering connections are shown to assist the DAE model in learning filtering operators that exploit richer inter-frequency structures.",

Voice activity detection algorithm is an important part of many communication devices, such as mobile phones, because they can be used for example to reduce battery consumption and bandwidth usage. However, the communication devices and also the circumstances in which they are used vary greatly, and thus there does not exist one such voice activity detection algorithm that could be used in every case effectively but the algorithm has to be developed specifically for the problem at hand. In the thesis a voice activity detection algorithm was developed to be used in circumstances, where a very high-level breathing sound is present in the signal. Because the property is unique when compared to previous studies, previously developed voice activity detection algorithms could not be used. Instead, a new voice activity detection algorithm that constitutes of framewise feature extraction, classification of the features and postprocessing was developed. This was done by testing many different options for the parts of the voice activity detection algorithm, evaluating systematically their contribution to the results of the detection and selecting the best combination of parts as the final voice activity detection algorithm. The final voice activity detection algorithm constitutes of Mel-frequency band energies as the features, neural network as the classifier and hidden Markov model as the postprocessing method.

    abstract = "The pressure changes of an acoustic wavefront are sensed with a microphone that acts as a transducer, converting sound pressure into voltage. The voltage is then converted into digital form with an analog to digital (AD) -converter to provide a discrete time quantized digital signal. This thesis discusses methods to estimate the location of a sound source from the signals of multiple microphones. Acoustic source localization (ASL) can be used to locate talkers, which is useful for speech communication systems such as teleconferencing and hearing aids. Active localization methods receive and send energy, whereas passive methods only receive energy. The discussed ASL methods are passive which makes them attractive for surveillance applications, such as localization of vehicles and monitoring of areas. This thesis focuses on ASL in a room environment and at moderate distances that are often present in outdoor applications. The frequency range of many commonly occurring sounds such as speech, vehicles, and jet aircraft is large. Time delay estimation (TDE) methods are suitable for estimating properties from such wideband signals. Since TDE methods have been extensively studied, the theory is attractive to apply in localization. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) -based methods estimate the source location from measured TDOA values between microphones. These methods are computationally attractive but deteriorate rapidly when the TDOA estimates are no longer directly related to the source position. In a room environment such conditions could be faced when reverberation or noise starts to dominate TDOA estimation. The combination of microphone pairwise TDE measurements is studied as a more robust localization solution. TDE measurements are combined into a spatial likelihood function (SLF) of source position. A sequential Bayesian method known as particle filtering (PF) is used to estimate the source position. The PF based localization accuracy increases when the variance of SLF decreases. Results from simulations and real-data show that multiplication (intersection operation) results in a SLF with smaller variance than the typically applied summation (union operation). The above localization methods assume that the source is located in the near-field of the microphone array, i.e., the source emitted wavefront curvature is observable. In the far-field, the source wavefront is assumed planar and localization is considered by using spatially separated direction observations. The direction of arrival (DOA) of a source emitted wavefront impinging on a microphone array is traditionally estimated by steering the array to a direction that maximizes the steered response power. Such estimates can be deteriorated by noise and reverberation. Therefore, talker localization is considered using DOA discrimination. The sound propagation delay from the source to the microphone array becomes significant at moderate distances. As a result, the directional observations from a moving sound source point behind the true source position. Omitting the propagation delay results in a biased location estimate of a moving or discontinuously emitting source. To solve this problem the propagation delay is proposed to be modeled in the estimation process. Motivated by the robustness of localization using the combination of TDE measurements, source localization by directly combining the TDE-based array steered responses is considered. This extends the near-field talker localization methods to far-field source localization. The presented propagation delay modeling is then proposed for the steered response localization. The improvement in localization accuracy by including the propagation delay is studied using a simulated moving sound source in the atmosphere. The presented indoor localization methods have been evaluated in the Classification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) 2006 and CLEAR'07 technology evaluations. In the evaluations, the performance of the proposed ASL methods was evaluated by a third party from several hours of annotated data. The data was gathered from meetings held in multiple smart rooms. According to the obtained results from CLEAR'07 development dataset (166 min) presented in this thesis, 92 \% of speech activity in a meeting situation was located within 17 cm accuracy.",

Ad-hoc arrays hold a vast potential for audio applications, but they are inherently asynchronous, i.e., temporal offset exists in each channel, and furthermore the device locations are generally unknown. Therefore, the data is not directly suitable for traditional microphone array applications such as source localization and beamforming. This work presents a least squares method for temporal offset estimation of a static ad-hoc microphone array. The method utilizes the captured audio content without the need to emit calibration signals, provided that during the recording a sufficient amount of sound sources surround the array. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator is given and the effect of limited number of surrounding sources on the solution accuracy is investigated. A practical implementation is then presented using non-linear filtering with automatic parameter adjustment. Simulations over a range of reverberation and noise levels demonstrate the algorithm's robustness.

    abstract = "This paper presents an algorithm for multichannel sound source separation using explicit modeling of level and time differences in source spatial covariance matrices (SCM). We propose a novel SCM model in which the spatial properties are modeled by the weighted sum of direction of arrival (DOA) kernels. DOA kernels are obtained as the combination of phase and level difference covariance matrices representing both time and level differences between microphones for a grid of predefined source directions. The proposed SCM model is combined with the NMF model for the magnitude spectrograms. Opposite to other SCM models in the literature, in this work, source localization is implicitly defined in the model and estimated during the signal factorization. Therefore, no localization pre-processing is required. Parameters are estimated using complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) with both Euclidean distance and Itakura Saito divergence. Separation performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the two-channel SiSEC development dataset and four channels signals recorded in a regular room with moderate reverberation. Finally, a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods is performed, showing better achieved separation performance in terms of SIR and perceptual measures.",

This paper proposes augmentation of the localization metrics with a condition related to the detection, and conversely, use of location information in calculating the true positives for detection. An extensive evaluation example is provided to illustrate the behavior of such joint metrics. The comparison to the detection only and localization only performance shows that the proposed joint metrics operate in a consistent and logical manner, and characterize adequately both aspects.",

The tracking performance of the CRNN is compared with a stand-alone tracking method that combines a multi-source (DOA) estimator and a particle filter. Their respective performance is evaluated in various acoustic conditions such as anechoic and reverberant scenarios, stationary and moving sources at several angular velocities, and with a varying number of overlapping sources.

This study applies spectral factorisation algorithms and long temporal context for separating speech and noise from mixed signals. To adapt the system to varying environments, noise models are acquired from the context, or learnt from the mixture itself without prior information. We also propose methods for reducing the size of the bases used for speech and noise modelling by 20-40 times for better practical applicability. We evaluate the performance of the methods both as a standalone classifier and as a signal-enhancing front-end for external recognisers.

The new method, called binary nonnegative matrix deconvolution (BNMD), is developed and used to discover patterns from magnitude-scale spectrograms. The BNMD models an audio spectrogram as a sum of delayed patterns having binary gains (activations). Only small subsets of patterns can be active for a given spectrogram excerpt. The proposed method was applied to speaker identification and separation tasks. The experimental results show that dictionaries obtained by the BNMD bring much higher speaker identification accuracies averaged over a range of SNRs from -6 dB to 9 dB (91.3\%) than the NMD-based dictionaries (37.8-75.4\%). The BNMD also gives a benefit over dictionaries obtained using vector quantization (87.8\%). For bigger dictionaries the difference between the BNMD and the vector quantization (VQ) is getting smaller. For the speech separation task the BNMD dictionary gave a slight improvement over the VQ.",

    abstract = "This thesis proposes signal processing methods for analysis of singing voice audio signals, with the objectives of obtaining information about the identity and lyrics content of the singing. Two main topics are presented, singer identification in monophonic and polyphonic music, and lyrics transcription and alignment. The information automatically extracted from the singing voice is meant to be used for applications such as music classification, sorting and organizing music databases, music information retrieval, etc. For singer identification, the thesis introduces methods from general audio classification and specific methods for dealing with the presence of accompaniment. The emphasis is on singer identification in polyphonic audio, where the singing voice is present along withmusical accompaniment. The presence of instruments is detrimental to voice identification performance, and eliminating the effect of instrumental accompaniment is an important aspect of the problem. The study of singer identification is centered around the degradation of classification performance in presence of instruments, and separation of the vocal line for improving performance. For the study, monophonic singing was mixed with instrumental accompaniment at different signalto- noise (singing-to-accompaniment) ratios and the classification process was performed on the polyphonic mixture and on the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture. The method for classification including the step for separating the vocals is improving significantly the performance compared to classification of the polyphonic mixtures, but not close to the performance in classifying the monophonic singing itself. Nevertheless, the results show that classification of singing voices can be done robustly in polyphonic music when using source separation. In the problem of lyrics transcription, the thesis introduces the general speech recognition framework and various adjustments that can be done before applying themethods on singing voice. The variability of phonation in singing poses a significant challenge to the speech recognition approach. The thesis proposes using phoneme models trained on speech data and adapted to singing voice characteristics for the recognition of phonemes and words from a singing voice signal. Language models and adaptation techniques are an important aspect of the recognition process. There are two different ways of recognizing the phonemes in the audio: one is alignment, when the true transcription is known and the phonemes have to be located, other one is recognition, when both transcription and location of phonemes have to be found. The alignment is, obviously, a simplified form of the recognition task. Alignment of textual lyrics to music audio is performed by aligning the phonetic transcription of the lyrics with the vocal line separated from the polyphonic mixture, using a collection of commercial songs. The word recognition is tested for transcription of lyrics from monophonic singing. The performance of the proposed system for automatic alignment of lyrics and audio is sufficient for facilitating applications such as automatic karaoke annotation or song browsing. The word recognition accuracy of the lyrics transcription from singing is quite low, but it is shown to be useful in a query-by-singing application, for performing a textual search based on the words recognized from the query. When some key words in the query are recognized, the song can be reliably identified.",

Through the semantic component, the method is able to handle variability in labels of sound events. Through the acoustic component, the method retrieves acoustically similar examples. On a test database of over 3000 sound event examples, the proposed method obtains a better retrieval performance than audio-based retrieval, and returns results closer acoustically to the query than a label-based retrieval.",

In this paper, we introduce an anisotropic Gaussian source model in which both the magnitude and phase parameters are modeled as random variables. In such a model, it becomes possible to promote a phase value that originates from a signal model and to adjust the relative importance of this underlying model-based phase constraint. We conduct Bayesian inference of the model through the derivation of an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters. Experiments conducted on realistic music songs for a monaural source separation task, in an scenario where the variance parameters are assumed known, show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.",

In particular, the multiple input spectrogram inversion (MISI) algorithm has been exploited successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter. First, it has originally been introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals. Experiments conducted on a speech separation task show that oMISI performs as well as its offline counterpart, thus demonstrating its potential for real-time source separation.",

    abstract = "Abstract The increase of mobile devices and most recently wearables has raised the interest to utilize their sensors for various applications such as indoor localization. We present the first acoustic self-localization scheme that is passive, and is capable of operating when sensors are moving, and possibly unsynchronized. As a result, the relative microphone positions are obtained and therefore an ad hoc microphone array has been established. The proposed system takes advantage of the knowledge that a device is worn by its user e.g. attached to his/her clothing. A user here acts as a sound source and the sensor is the user-worn microphone. Such an entity is referred to as a node. Node-related spatial information is obtained from Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimated from audio captured by the nodes. Kalman filtering is used for node tracking and prediction of spatial information during periods of node silence. Finally, the node positions are recovered using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The only information required by the proposed system is observations of sounds produced by the nodes such as speech to localize the moving nodes. The general framework for acoustic self-localization is presented followed by an implementation to demonstrate the concept. Real data collected by off-the-shelf equipment is used to evaluate the positioning accuracy of nodes in contrast to image based method. The presented system achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 cm in an acoustic laboratory.",

The intelligibility of modern TTS systems is considered relatively high thus the current emphasis is on developing the naturalness of the synthetic speech. Unit selection speech synthesis utilizes a large pre-recorded speech inventory which provides a sufficient phonetic and prosodic coverage for the language. In synthesis, the best sequence of units, typically half phones or diphones, is retrieved from the inventory and the concatenation of the units is carried out. Unlike in traditional concatenative TTS systems based on prosodic modification, no processing of unit waveforms is required. This increases the quality of the speech by avoiding the modification of units. In this thesis, the full process of constructing a TUT\_VOICE unit selection TTS synthesizer for Finnish is described. The work consisted of the construction of a Finnish voice and the implementation of a synthesis engine. The voice construction included inventory design, recording of a speech inventory with a female voice, phonetic labeling of the speech, and feature extraction. The implementation included building a target unit sequence based on the text to be synthesized, selecting the best sequence of speech units in the inventory, and creation of the output speech waveform by concatenating the selected units. Synthesis quality was in accordance with the expectations: intelligibility was good but quality varied from excellent to poor among different sentences.",

    abstract = "New methods for the design, analysis and generalization of polynomial predictive filters (polynomial predictors for short) are developed in this thesis. Polynomial predictors are a subclass of linear mathematical filters, i.e. linear transformations that transform an input sequence of numbers to an output sequence. Filters are in general used to modify or extract useful information from a signal. Examples of filters are echo cancellers in telephone networks, vocal tract filters in speech synthesizers and analysis filters for EEG signals. Polynomial predictors are useful in situations where the signal of interest changes relatively slowly. Examples of slowly varying signals that can be successfully modeled by polynomials include displacement curves of elevators, the received power level in mobile communication systems and angular accelaration in motor drives. Generally, the filtering of a signal causes delay. However, in many applications, particularly control systems, it is desirable to minimize the delay caused by filtering. Furthermore, the signals in any real-world application contain noise, which we also wish to minimize by filtering. For example, calculating the moving average of a signal generally reduces the noise in the signal, but also causes delay. Polynomial predictors are filters that can predict polynomial signals, and in addition reduce the noise in the signal. In this thesis we determine the precise class of IIR filters which are polynomial predictors, which unifies the various previously proposed predictor structures. Design methods are developed for optimal least-squares FIR polynomial predictors, which enable arbitrary prediction steps, error weighting and an arbitrary desired frequency response. The parameters of predictors based on the general IIR structure are optimized, yielding improvements over the best previously known IIR polynomial predictors. An analysis of the asymptotic properties of polynomial predictors as the filter length grows without bound is carried out, yielding insight into the characteristics of predictors in general, as well as proving a conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of the noise gain. Predictors are generalized for more general signal models than polynomials, and the resulting signal model (corresponding to the solutions of linear homogenous finite difference equations) is shown to be the most general possible. The generalization of the signal model can be interpreted in terms of a z-plane diagram which specifies the complex exponential signals that are predicted. The design methods for FIR polynomial predictors are also carried over to this general signal model. The generalized signal model includes e.g. sinusoidal signals and the design methods are applied to finding improved filters for use in a 50Hz line frequency signal processing application. In addition to the signal model, the filter type is also generalized. This yields design methods for finding the optimal parameters of differentiators, predictive differentiators and integrators, among others. The asymptotic noise gain of generalized predictors is derived and found to depend on the largest modulus of the complex numbers which specify the signal model. Furthermore, an efficient implementation for generalized FIR predictors is derived.",

    abstract = "Loudspeaker is a device that converts electric input signal to acoustic output. The most common type of loudspeaker is a moving-coil transducer. The behaviour of a moving-coil transducer can be considered to be linear only when displacement of the coil-diaphragm assembly is small. When input signal level rises, nonlinearities start to cause audible distortion. In this thesis we examine microspeaker, a small loudspeaker used in mobile phones. The electro-mechanical process which converts the electrical signal into sound waves is exaplained. Based on this, we present a continuous-time, linear model of a loudspeaker mounted in a closed box. The model describes the loudspeaker’s small-signal behaviour using only few parameters. We then consider the main sources of nonlinearities and how to model them. Two major sources nonlinearities are added to the continuous-time model. Then transformations from continuous-time models to discrete-time models are considered. The nonlinear model is converted to discrete-time while taking into account the properties of the microspeaker. The main purpose of this thesis is to study performance of a algorithm that ﬁnds the parameter values of the nonlinear loudspeaker model. Performance of the algorithm is compared to performance of an earlier algorithm for the linear loudspeaker model. The parameter values are found and changes in them are tracked using an adaptive signal processing method called system identiﬁcation. The parameter values are updated using LMS algorithm. Since the discrete-time mechanical model of the microspeaker is based on a recursive ﬁlter, LMS algorithm for recursive ﬁlters is presented. We also review previous research related to parameter identiﬁcation in linear and nonlinear loudspeaker models. Based on results from the experiments the studied algorithm is deemed to be yet incomplete. Linear parameters adapt in general quickly whereas the nonlinear parameters adapt too slowly and sometimes erroneously. The diﬀerence between the output predicted by the nonlinear loudspeaker model and the actual output of the loudspeaker (prediction error) is too high, meaning the parameters do not adapt to their true values. The model is also prone to instability. The algorithm requires further development regarding adaptation speed and prevention of instability. Other development considering initial parameter values and operation during silent moments should also be conducted in the future.",

    abstract = "Automatic extraction of acoustic regions of interest from recordings captured in realistic clinical environments is a necessary preprocessing step in any cry analysis system. In this study, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based audio segmentation method to identify the relevant acoustic parts of the cry signal (i.e., expiratory and inspiratory phases) from recordings made in natural environments with various interfering acoustic sources. We examine and optimize the performance of the system by using different audio features and HMM topologies. In particular, we propose using fundamental frequency and aperiodicity features. We also propose a method for adapting the segmentation system trained on acoustic material captured in a particular acoustic environment to a different acoustic environment by using feature normalization and semi-supervised learning (SSL). The performance of the system was evaluated by analyzing a total of 3 h and 10 min of audio material from 109 infants, captured in a variety of recording conditions in hospital wards and clinics. The proposed system yields frame-based accuracy up to 89.2\%. We conclude that the proposed system offers a solution for automated segmentation of cry signals in cry analysis applications.",
